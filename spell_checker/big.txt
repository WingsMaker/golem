Both San Pedro Airport air carriers have regular daily flights to seven major destinations throughout Belize and "On-Demand" stops can be arranged at airstrips on island and resort hide aways scattered throughout the country and along the barrier reef.
Both Saturday flights are to Atlanta.
Both airlines brought high-profile aviation pioneers who would give the airline the panache of being called "The Airline Run by Flyers".
Both in Boston and layover in Miami AA airlines personnel handled luggage and had way over an hour to board it.The both contain seven days of clothes and unnderwear.
Bottiglia has just watched Flight 11's radar blip disappear, which means the plane has dipped below his radar's coverage area, so is below 2,000 feet.
Bridges said the recorders were found "right where the plane came into the building".

British Airways, the largest trans-Atlantic operator, dropped four of the 12 daily flights operated in partnership with American Airlines, with the last due to arrive in New York at 6 p.m. eastern.
Broomstick - I'd like a flight in a later Cold War era plane preferable, doesn't need to be any fancy stuff like aerobatics although that would be a bonus, western or eastern aircraft doesn't matter but the Russians seem to be the only people who do it.
Budget-savvy travelers can find great discounts on cheap flights to seattle because our travel experts have negotiated amazing airfare rates with all the major airlines.
Bueno Requests Fighters, Told to Call NEADS - Bueno tells the controller at the Otis tower that Flight 11 has lost its identification signal and appears to be headed toward Manhattan; it looks like a possible hijacking, and fighter jets are needed, fast.
Buses meet all the flights that arrive here.
Buses: Three buses stop near the airdrome (District of La Fortuna): the 483 and 487, which cover the Aluche-Leganés route, and the 486, covering Oporto-Leganés.
But I WANT the flights!
But I couldn't find the same flight on ITA.
But I'm curious how early a flight have people actually made out of Ft lauderdale airport when the ship docks at port everglades.
But I'm curious how early a flight have people actually made out of Ft lauderdale airport, when the ship docked at port everglades.
But after all that has been done to reduce delays, the biggest drop has been because of the airlines' reductions in the number of scheduled flights since 2007.
But airline officials said that many of the people that flew the Reno-Minneapolis route connected to other destinations, which prevented Northwest from raising fares higher than competitors in those other destinations.
But airlines have no reason, and certainly no obligation, to offer you the lowest price.
But always make sure you have time to get back to the airport early enough to get back through security, so you don't miss your flight !
But at this time, I'm just interested in showing that I have an exit flight.
But by pushing its international Boeing Co. 757s to nearly the limit of their roughly 4,000-nautical-mile range, United is leaving little room for error when stiff winds increase the amount of fuel the planes' twin engines burn.
But every airline has its own set of rules when it comes to stopovers and we will be going over that soon.
But for sure you won't be able to avoid the problems during early morning flights.
But he can maneuver around the room without running into things, and he is spilling speed well when landing on my hand, which is very good.
But he was in for a surprise: a couple of weeks ago, Delta called him and told him he was now on a flight leaving JFK around 6 AM, and he'd have to make a connection both coming and going.
But how much will adding an open jaw and the additional one way flight cost us?
But if you want the cheapest possible round-trip from the USA home to India, Ireland, Nigeria, or wherever, no general-purpose agency, even a general discount agency, is likely to be able to beat the lowest prices of a no-service, bare-bones, specialist agency within that particular ethnic community that sells nothing else but a massive volume of round-trip tickets to a single destination.
But it doesn't hurt to start early with the planning, You may save BIG BUCKS & get your ticket cheaper than everyone else on the plane.
But it will not show me flights anymore than 2 months in advance.
But keep in mind what I said earlier: for round-trip tickets to a single destination, the lowest prices are usually from specialists in that particular destination, not from multi- destination specialists like most of the ASFA members.
But let's assume you're right, I don't feel like checking what are the most profitable airlines making on their flights, but I'll do it in near future.
But sadly, they had stopped flying international and Kolkata.
But there's a price to be paid for convenience and comfort, and the Smari is worth it if you need to catch an early morning flight from Keflavik, rested and refreshed.
But these days, when everything flight-related has a price tag, you'll pay $99 for an "upgrade" to the front section of coach, just for the right to get off the plane more quickly (although in some cases it does admittedly buy you an inch or so of extra legroom -- check out our article on Airline Perks Worth Paying For).
But they could have been talking about total trip time not flight time as airlines quote the total time to get somewhere including stopovers.
But this Easter, only United and Northwest offered what I'd call a very mild fare sale -- the discounts were not all that deep, and they were only good for trips through mid- to late-June.
But those seats come with a cost, whether in cash or in miles, and you don't get all that much more than the folks in coach -- it's usually the same meals, albeit for "free", the same headphones with the same movies or DirecTV, and the same limited seat incline.
But today, it's all about the "Stopover".
But up on my arrival from Taipei which was a long flight any way I just need to get home and rest.
But use kayak.com to find those flights on the day with one ways each time.
But what is highly unusual is that they use a single seat chart for a flight number that physically changes aircraft during a stopover.
But when he saw the aircraft, he told me its an A320.
But when ten o'clock arrived, and the wind was as brisk as ever, we decided that we had a better get the machine out and attempt a flight.
But when you come to book the flight, the APD is included.
But which is the direction of the flights?
But, D.C. F.A.A. put out a new possible ruling which will disallow all laptops……so stupid, don't they know Jet Blue has laptops on every aircraft and soon all airliners will for the electronic Jepp charts.
But, if I want a nonstop flight or better fare I fly out of LAX
But, when I went to board the flight 201 from JFK to LAX, the man spied the mustard, checked the bag and said he had to throw it out!

By August 1981, American had retired all its Boeing 707s aircraft, including their freighters.
By providing us with your airline, flight number, and expected arrival time, our staff will be prepared to serve you in the event of a late flight arrival.
By the end of the day it is a struggle to stay awake but when I crash, I get a good night's sleep and get accustomed to Pacific time.On the way back I like to take an afternoon flight back which alows me to sleep late in the am, get a leisurely breakfast and get to the airport without having to rush.
By the late 1930's the airline had become the United States largest air carrier.
By utilizing your stopover in the States after an international award flight on United, you are getting some insane value.
Bygone are those days when it was hard to book flights at the critical moment and people had to suffer a lot in order to book flights.

However Alaska and American Airlines have had a close relationship for many years including what were once called "interchange flights" that operated from Dallas and Chicago respectively through to Anchorage changing crews (American to Alaska) in Seattle.
However if you are referring to fare ticket availability, then you would need Flight Alerts which is part of our Premium service: http://www.expertflyer.com/frequent-flyer-programs The difference is important because an unoccupied seat doesn't imply an available ticket.
However you can find flights out of Singapore - got to the top right corner where it has the Australian flag and country code as Australia - change it to Singapore - which is there only other country at the present time but I hope they expand.
However you have to be vigilant enough in finding when prices fall and when you can book cheap international flights.
However, ALL other airlines were flying as per normal - what a lame excuse from AA.
However, Delta presently is the dominant airline representing nearly three quarters of all airlines.
However, FlyerTalk member Baze wonders what would happen if the flight gets delayed or canceled - and if the delay is long enough so it does not take off until after the changeover, will its flight number change?
However, I was refused a checkin because I was"late", and the flight was closed.
However, Lastminute.com's told us top secret flight prices are always cheaper than booking direct, or booking the same flights as branded.
However, airlines routinely keep their jets in service for 20 years or more, so it is definitely possible that a passenger flying today might find himself aboard an older aircraft with less shielding.
However, all I have been able to find to date are flights from these airports via New... of our 18 days!
However, door-to-door time may be 20 hours or more, depending upon layovers and flight change...
However, if your flight, hotel and other other elements like car hire were booked separately, there will be no automatic refund for the accommodation and other elements if you cannot find a suitable replacement flight.
However, these same people often need a car the most....
However, they are now charging fuel surcharges when US Airways bundles it into the fare (for you geeks out there, US Airways does not add a YQ fuel surcharge, but they do bundle it into the fare on TransAtlantic flights).
However, they only show four pages of flights, so midday they may not have tomorrow morning's arrivals.
However, this terrible experience with AA has left us fuming and disappointed with what they claim to be "a leading airline".
However, travelers who are making stops in the U.S., Canada or Brazil will have different weight allowances that vary depending on route.
However, what we might surmise from today's challenge is that somehow, security authorities believe that the plan was to have two or three fundamentalist soldiers board each aircraft carrying different liquids or detonating devices such as watches (yes, watches, like the nytro-watch combo they planned to use over the Pacific in the '90s), then mix the liquids and attach whatever rudimentary detonators inflight and then, "boom".
However, what you may not know is the major airlines, due to problems of late such as bankruptcy, are actually making an effort to undercut the prices of some of the cheaper smaller carriers.
However, you need booking details of return flight together with L application and passport.
However; when I got the airport, I was told that the plane would be delayed or canceled, thus, I can not get Indianapolis that night.

I never flew Southwest to Orlando, but I'm flying to Baltimore next month on Southwest and the earliest flight they had was around 7 a.m. Or are you looking for earlier?
I never got off the ground; was finally sent to Delta which also had my "new flight" pushed back 3 hours so I missed all the connectors and I just went home.
I never would believe it would have been an 11 hours layover.
I noticed the Tripadvisor flight search tool still gives flight booking results that include Aeosur flights.
I noticed two things: Blue Air had the cheapest fare for the roundtrip BRU-BBU and Brussels Airlines was selling the Tarom flights as codeshare partner at a cheaper price.
I once spent 20 minutes in the baggage claim at LAS waiting for my bags, and it took 20 minutes from when the plane parked for me to get off the plane, get to the tram station, and ride the tram to the terminal.
I only find out that the airport in Bandar Lampung is called Raden Inten II Aiport but what are the airlines tat touch down in that airport?
I only flew a bixler till now and i am still a beginner and i would like to know if i can fly this plane or if it will be to advance for me?
I only had a 40 minute layover and the flight was 15 minutes late.
I ordered one off the last before the plane's went to back order,and I have received a tracking number off EMS.
I paid 49.99 euro (incl. all fees i.e. 15 euro checked bag) for a Blue Air flight from BRU to BBU on Friday night and 116.66 euro for the Brussels Airlines flight (operated by Tarom) from OTP to BRU on Monday afternoon.
I picked the seats when I booked the flight.
I politely explained that I was on the flight that was cancelled, Flight 4089 from Albany to Newark, was re-booked for the following day and would like to see if I could be placed on a flight to arrive in SFO Tuesday evening.
I put some wingtip skids on mine just to help on those not quite level landings,don't know how much that will effect flight though.
I realize the ship docks early that morning (between 6 and 7 probably), but Customs may be slow to clear the ship, or a myriad of other delays may occur, and then you'll miss your flight.
I really love their show and the planes they fly, going to make me go bankrupt lol.
I recently picked-up a puppy that had traveled from Mo. to Grand Rapids by way of Dallas.
I recently wrote a piece on when to shop and buy Southwest Airlines tickets (check it out if you are near one of their 70 cities).
I recommend this strategy for late-night or early-morning flights... this way you'll save one night's fee in renting a car.
I remember flipping through a timetable when I was young seeing Delta with a ton of high four digit flight numbers that were all assigned to the same flight.
I remember helping my girlfriend find a flight from Canada to Peru not long ago.
I said all the airlines her and not one is going to PHILA,, today?
I said it here back in November, and I will say it again: Continental Airlines treated me well when I was a top-tier frequent flier for several years, and I will certainly miss that airline.
I said ok that?s fine but does the chairs recline because we have been flying for the last two days and our previous nine hour flight had no reclining chairs.
I said, well finally got on the flight. so, needless to say I am very angry with American Airlines and the paople at the counter as they were all so rude, the only people that were nice is when the airline hostesses came to get on board and saw me crying, they said they would take care of me. so no thanks I will not fly American again and never will reco9mmend it to anyone, have a nice day i sure had an awful night, Teresa Sandford from flt 1021
I say this because the threat was, after all, against three US airlines - AA, CO and UA -and the alledged intention was to blow up these American aircraft over five so far un-named US cities.
I see no problem with range and have experienced no range problems at all in any of my planes. from my experience to lose control you'd have to be so far away you couldn't see which direction the plane is going.
I should've known when the only flight to Lauderdale... was at 6: 10 a.m., and the only rental car I could get was this ridiculous Lincoln.
I showed it to two American Airlines employees at the baggage pick-up area and was told the airlines was not responsible for damaged luggage.
I simply don't understand why people rant about their service on board, when it's the aircraft going through difficult times.
I spoke on behalf of my husband and I apologized and explained to her that the ticket was purchased thru Lan Chile and we were at Lan Chile for over an hour before we were told that the flight was actually thru AA.
I still don't have my license but I want an effing car.
I stopped off in a bathroom and then made my way over to my next gate.
I stormed back to the desk where a different woman was working and asked what the price for a one-way ticket to Chicago was.
I struggled to find a seat at all on the plane, so I didn't get to sit by a window.
I suppose that the price of the full fare seats could change that much, but it would seem unusual unless Air France jacked up all their fares.
I think AA feels I should be grateful for the tiny croissant they gave me hours later, before a three hour layover at Heathrow.
I think I found it once on Shanghai airport website (or all airports in China) giving all flights taking off and real time flight in ...
I think Pinnacle flies ALL the Northwest flights out of Charleston.
I think anyone who cares enough should boycott all airlines, especially American Airlines, as much as possible then they'll see how it feels in their wallets at the end of the day.
I think it's not so much a matter of not being able to find the flights you want on the sites - I don't think they exist...
I think my problem stems from the fact that I'm a bit of a control freak, ie when I'm driving or whatever, and I need to know that the same people flying me are as committed to "driving" me as safely as I would myself.
I think that you should send the first people what were waiting out on the plane.
I think the issue with the wing fixing is that when landing if you catch a wingtip or the model digs into the ground, then it can break the centre mounting tabs.
I think the process makes sens from the logistics stand point also, since they probably have a better idea about the load (considering last minute operational issues, upgrade clearance and etc) within the 12 hours of flight departure but not necessary before up to 36 hours of flight.
I think they block ticketing when you only book ticket on DL now… Can't ticket my LAX-SFO, prompted up error.
I think you should compensate all the passengers on this flight with partial refund or some kind of ticket voucher.
I thought it would be helpful to put together a chart of which airlines charge fuel surcharges on award tickets and which do not.
I thought it would be useful for those who have an interest in booking a one way ticket from anywhere in the US to anywhere in Canada and just need to find the cheapest flight possible on any whatever airline they are looking for.
I told her I have the flight confirmation in front of me and it has my name as the person who purchased the damn ticket and I have no right to know if she even boarded the damn plane?!
I told the agent all other airlines will give the option of no fees if the flight was done in the following 12 months, but she continued to be less then friendly or helpful.
I traveled with my 15 month old baby, first of all they do not give priority to bord the plane to people with babies, I requested a bassinet about 2 weeks prior my 9hrs fligth..guest what?
I travelled with my husband and ten year old daughter in several AA flights these holidays, and they managed to put us all in different seats, regardless of the fact my daughter is still a minor and obviously should travel accompanied by at least one the parents, one of the flights lasted for about seven hours from NY to Madrid.
I tried ITA etc but the earliest flight back into ORD is from FRA on AI which lands around 1015.
I understand that there is a hurricane and that was no one's fault but when your trying to get through to them to get assistance to change your flights so you can get back home and there is not one person that will help you at all well that is fustrating and the website is not helpful at all.
I understand that when a plane bursts into flames the flames fall, but this was a fire going up towards the plane".
I understand that when you tell them where you want to go, they pick the cheapest flight.

I urge you to make your decisions on what you feel is the best fit for your goal, wants, and budgets when it comes to hiring a coach.
I use agency software to find all of my flights as website like Expedia will filter out certain airlines and flights.
I used for the first time AA to fly to the US, nad was shocked when entering the plane.
I waited from 4:30 to finally 10:00 when we finally boarded the plane.
I waited on hold for 3 hrs before I got someone who told me sll we could do pay more to upgrade to first class on another flight (which would get us to Cancun a day late & the 4 of us would not get to travel on the same flight) or they would refund our money after I submit something in writing.

I was cabin crew, and the majority of airports don't check how many pieces of hand luggage you have, it used to be our job to monitor the amount of cabin baggage coming onto the aircraft.
I was charged $150.00 over the phone, when I checked in at the A/A desk the lady asked me for my credit card once again she charged me $150.00 I was thinking that they were confirming the extra charge because I was changing the flight dates. several days later I noticed my bank statement of being charged twice I called numerous times to the refund line which disconnects you because they say all there customer service reps are busy and to try again later, no mater what time of day you call it's the same response.

My daughter was to fly from St. Marteen to Miami through AA at 8:00 am on 17th August 2012, she was told that there was a delay and she would leave at 3:00pm and at 3:00pm she was told that due to some weather problems she would be leaving from there at around 12 noon the next day i.e 18th August and the customer care and the airport staff were so rude to even justify the reason, she took a hotel room there (which should have been provided by the Airlines but they didn't).

My husband and I were to fly Continental on July 8, 2011 but when we arrived at the airport our flight was cancelled.
My husband had a ticket from las to phx on a later flight because of a mess up from the reservation and was told there was no room on my flight and he had to wait for the later flight, only to find out there was an open seat next to me and was never filled.
My husband had very pleasant meals - some of them not including meat - but I was told that there were only enough of these for the number of people on the plane.
My major reasons for being in F are: it's a bit of a special occasion for us and, in addition to that, both myself and the girlfriend cannot sleep on planes (at all) and thus we try to get as comfortable as we can and just enjoy the flight.
My mom had the worst experience expereince travelling with them where her flight was delayed and she was stuck in SFO for 3 days as an in transit passenger who was flying out to NZ.

Read all the other comments from frequent flyers about american airlines employees.
Read the car rental contract carefully, especially the section that describes what kind of driver's license you are using to rent the car.
Read the fine print, as some fares are listed as "half-round-trip" to give the impression the price is lower, when you must actually double that rate to get the true fare.
Read the flight table to find the aircraft type (At).
Read the information displayed for your flight.
Read the seat table to find every passenger number for a particular flight.
Read them all in the full How To Get A Flight Upgrade guide.
Read through the ticketing information and raise questions early, while you can still clarify how to prepare your baggage rather than finding out the worst possible when you arrive at the airport in time for the flight.

Recent attempts to keep the site competitive have led to the upcoming introduction of "Home Brand Airfares", which means that the identity of the airline is not revealed to the user until the time of booking.

Recently, British Airways has announced its decision to axe its earliest morning flight leaving from Glasgow Airport to Heathrow.
Referring to Flight 11's radar track, he tells Hartling, "This - this aircraft, we believe, is hijacked, and he's last reported at 29,000 feet".
Refunds can be provided in most circumstances, except when a customer voluntarily changes seats on the same flight or does not show up for the flight.
Regular auction sites include SkyAuction.com, which sells available airline tickets and vacation packages.
Remember that St. Kitts/Nevis are on Atlantic Standard Time all year long (they don't observe Daylight Saving Time) so if you are planning to fly during the time when Daylight Saving Time is in effect you have to adjust your overall flight times accordingly.

Shall I book t his flight for you?
Shane sat at a table, drinking a cup of coffee, watching all the arriving flights come in, seeing people reunite, hug, kiss, jump into each others arms.
She didn't even know what was going on until we got off the plane.
She finally found someone helpful, a gentleman named Stewart, who gave her information about her connecting flight, and setting up my sister to fly out of Pittsburgh on May 16.
She has been told she could obtain one when a flight is delayed due to mechanical failure.
She histologically collapsed on cheapest flights round trip from montrea of him, giddily beneficial and exhausted, as he came capillary from his archaeological high.
She just did not want to accomodate my request at all, was wanting to bypass me and displace the family with the dog, even after i had told her i was Asthmatic and could end up having an asthma attack because of the Dog .I asked her name as we were getting off the plane in Chicago and she wouldn't give me her last name.
She literally verbally abused the individual for speaking to her (I guess) then when he attempted to explain he was about to miss his flight, her response was "I don't need any back talk!"
She may also give you a confirmation code for a future flight credit.
She put us on a stand by list for a flight 7 hours later.
She quoted me a price of less than half what Delta wanted and checked a number of different flights to help me get my pets on the best flights for us.
She said it was Okay to visit in early October - so I have been on t'internet trying to book a flight from Stansted to Nice.
She stood, "I'm going to call the airport, I'll let you know when I get a flight".
She tells him the plane is flying very low.
She then said she could book me for a flight to DC or San Francisco.
She was also not able to book me on ANY other flight headed to San Francisco that evening other than changing airlines and making a stop in Atlanta, where I would have had a 9 hour layover.
She was told at the gate that flight 3302 had been delayed for takeoff because of bad weather.
She was told that her luggage would be on the flight.
She was told today that the fare for Lagos to DFW was 1360 originally and because Lybias leader was killed this past week that the fare is now 1810 and I am sure that you aren't doing this to am American citizen without a really good reason.
She went over to Northwest, found me a seat on their flight leaving in about 20 minutes, then came back to the counter and helped me convince the Northwest ticket agent that I could make that flight since I had no baggage.
She went to tell me they had to load a plane and if I was going to sit there and complain she'd make sure I did not get any help.

Wall Street Journal had several articles on Continental Airlines flights to the East Coast from Europe that have been forced to make unexpected stops in Canada (and smaller airports on the east coast) to fill up their fuel after running into unusually strong headwinds.

Was called by USAirways and told our flights had been cancelled and ended up cancelling my vacation plans we had been planning for months due to being unable to reschedule.
Was given a standy ticket for 5:30 that evening and was told that flight was overbooked but I could get on a flight at 9:30 that night and given another ticket that actually had a seat assignment and was told it was a boarding pass not standby.
Was issued a travel voucher for $400 when my flight was over-booked and I had no seat.
Was just wondering what you should expect to pay for flights:- From Singapore - Koh Samui & Koh Samui - Bangkok Am looking for the cheapest ...
Was over in Amsterdam for a few days last week and had to go via Edinburgh for an Easyjet flight.

We Have not received a report since our last flights.
We all know it sucks to have someone sitting in the middle seat on a plane, but it sucks more to be in the middle seat on a plane.
We always take the earliest nonstop flight and arrive at Bellagio anywhere from 7:30 till ten.
We are all aware not to use the first class lavatory or to sit in first class even though it may be empty.
We are doing the same thing in October- taking a late flight and checking in early our first day.
We are flying to San Juan Peurto Rico where we both have a layover in Dallas.
We are in this together as it does not matter what your nationality is when you board the effected UK-US flight.
We are looking to fly BA business class (my father has kindly donated a huge amount of airmiles)
We are not able to split the train ticket between Oslo-Myrdal/Myrdal-Oslo, so if you want to stop at Finse or Geilo on the Norway in a nutshell® tour you need to buy a new seat reservation for the train to Myrdal or Oslo the next day.
We are not the airlines so we can not say for certain when they might have cheap fares.
We are tourists intending to travel to visit in Chicago and went out of our way to book accomodation in New York to make this early morning flight.
We boarded the plane only to be told 30 min later we were to deboard and it would be late departing,thus putting our connecting flight in jeopardy.
We booked air to Barcelona on our Solstice cruise in Sept and once the flight times came through we couldn't face travelling at 2am to catch a flight at 6am at Edinburgh airport,we didn't much fancy the stop over via Amsterdam either!
We booked air with our cruise in Europe last year and about 4 months prior found much better prices on flights so cancelled the cruise air and booked flights on our own.
We called to see if they were on the next flight which was the last flight out and there was no record of a claim or record number after I wasted 4 hours in the airport the morning of 5/24/12 in aruba where we were told that we should come to the aruba airport once again at the final flight @8:40pm and they would meet us at the customs gate 20 mins after the flight arrived.
We came in Tue september 15 2009, flight:CO 480 first class(A) our names are PAUL KRAMARCZYK & JUDITH KRAMARCZYK
We can find that special cheap flight instantly.
We can fly non stop RT from Boston to LAX for $200 less than a 1 stop in and out of LGB.....Is LAX that much of a nightmare or is it worth the savings?
We can send you a Flight Alert when the flight you want drops below your chosen price.
We can take this bookkeeping hassle of your hands and notify you exactly when prices drop on over 500 airlines, in real-time.
We carried these same items on when we left Columbus but couldn't on the return flight.
We checked in at 11:00 a.m. that morning in Huntsville for our 12:45 flight to Chicago O'Hare only to be told that flight was 2 hrs late DUE TO THE CREW NOT SHOWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We compare flights worldwide to find you the cheapest flights available to your destination.
We did change my flight to go out the next day instead of the 13th, but what I did not understand was why did we have to pay such a big price change when I already had a ticket.

[ 9/11 Commission, 11/19/2003 pdf file; 9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 14 pdf file ] Halleck contacted the FAA's Boston Center at 8:29 a.m. to inquire about Flight 11 (see 8:29 a.m. September 11, 2001), and at 8:33 a.m. he called Marquis and passed on what he had just learned from the Boston Center about the crisis with the aircraft (see 8:33 a.m. September 11, 2001).
[ 9/11 Commission, 12/15/2003 pdf file ] However, there are no reports of an ELT going off at the time when Flight 11 hits the WTC.
[ 9/11 Commission, 5/23/2003 ] An early FAA report will say only that Boston controllers begin "inter-facility coordination" with New York air traffic control at this time [ Federal Aviation Administration, 9/17/2001 pdf file ], but the New York Times reports that controllers at Washington Center also know "about the hijacking of the first plane to crash, even before it hit the World Trade Center".
[ 9/11 Commission, 7/24/2004, pp. 20 ] Its technicians realize they need to find the location of the hijacked plane quickly, so that the weapons team will be able to pass this information on to any fighter jets that are launched after it.
[ 9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 12 pdf file ] Minutes earlier, Marquis instructed Bill Halleck, an air traffic control specialist at the SOC, to contact the Boston Center to find out what was happening with Flight 11, and Halleck has just done so (see 8:29 a.m. September 11, 2001).
[ 9/11 Commission, 8/26/2004, pp. 9 pdf file ] He asked Halleck to contact the FAA's Boston Center and find out what is happening with Flight 11.
[ 9/11 Commission, 9/30/2003 pdf file; 9/11 Commission, 2004 ] Daniel Bueno, a supervisor at the FAA's Boston Center, has just called Spence at the Cape TRACON, which is located on Otis Air Base at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and said he wanted fighter jets scrambled in response to Flight 11, which is a "possible hijack".
[ Aviation Week and Space Technology, 6/3/2002; Cape Cod Times, 8/21/2002; BBC, 9/1/2002 ] At NEADS, the mission crew commander Major Kevin Nasypany orders his Weapons Team, which controls the fighters, to put the Otis planes on "battle stations".
[ Boston Globe, 11/23/2001 ] The Los Angeles Times reports that, when flight attendant Amy Sweeney makes a phone call from the plane, she says the hijackers have "just gained access to the cockpit".
[ Christian Science Monitor, 9/13/2001; Federal Aviation Administration, 9/17/2001 pdf file; National Transportation Safety Board, 2/19/2002 pdf file; MSNBC, 9/11/2002 ] Before this turn, the FAA had tagged Flight 11's radar dot for easy visibility and, at American Airlines' System Operations Control (SOC) in Fort Worth, Texas, "All eyes watched as the plane headed south.
[ Christian Science Monitor, 9/13/2001; MSNBC, 9/15/2001; Associated Press, 8/12/2002 ] Initial stories after 9/11 suggest the transponder is turned off around 8:13 a.m., but Pete Zalewski, the air traffic controller handling the flight, later says the transponder is turned off at 8:20 a.m. [ MSNBC, 9/11/2002 ] The 9/11 Commission places it at 8:21 a.m. [ 9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004 ] Colonel Robert Marr, head of NEADS, claims the transponder is turned off some time after 8:30 a.m. where the Flight 11 hijack was first detected a.m. [ ABC News, 9/11/2002 ]
[ Daily Telegraph, 9/16/2001 ] Flight 77 reportedly comes within four miles of the White House before turning toward the Pentagon.
[ Filson, 2003, pp. 47; Spencer, 2008, pp. 22 ] Otis Air Base, at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, is one of NORAD's seven alert sites in the continental United States, which keeps two armed fighter jets ready for immediate takeoff.

[ Florida State Times, 11/2001; Airman, 9/2002; Filson, 2003, pp. 122 ] Minutes after the crash, Deskins calls Arias again and tells him, "We think the aircraft that just hit the World Trade Center was American Airlines Flight 11".
[ Grant, 2004, pp. 20 ] Arnold will later recall that it is his and Marr's intention to place the fighters in "Whiskey 105" - military airspace over the Atlantic Ocean, just south of Long Island - "since neither he nor Marr knew where the hijacked aircraft was".
[ Guardian, 10/17/2001; Boston Globe, 11/23/2001; 9/11 Commission, 6/17/2004 ] Apparently, Flight 175 is not told Flight 11 has been hijacked.
[ MSNBC, 9/11/2002; Spencer, 2008, pp. 37 ] Because he is focused on Flight 11, Bottiglia will not notice when Flight 175's transponder code changes at 8:47 (see 8:46 a.m.-8:47 a.m. September 11, 2001).
[ MSNBC, 9/11/2002; Spencer, 2008, pp. 41-42 ] However, the FAA's Indianapolis Center, which handles Flight 77, will reportedly not learn of the first hijackings until around 9:20 a.m. (see (9:20 a.m.-9:21 a.m.) September 11, 2001).
[ North Andover Eagle-Tribune, 9/6/2011; CNHI News Service, 9/9/2011 ] Flight 11 took off from Logan Airport at 7:59 a.m. (see (7:59 a.m.) September 11, 2001).

[ Spencer, 2008, pp. 40 ] McCain will later recall: "It's very unusual to find a search target, which is a plane with its transponder turned off, in that area.
[ Telegraph (Nashua), 9/12/2001; Associated Press, 9/13/2001; United Press International, 9/13/2001 ] It is unclear exactly when this incident occurs, though it is presumably shortly after 8:42, when Flight 175 has its last communication with air traffic control.

[Source: Associated Press] At some unknown point after the hijacking begins, Flight 11's talkback button is activated, which enables Boston flight controllers to hear what is being said in the cockpit.
[Source: CBC] When the FAA's Boston Center first contacts NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) to notify it of the hijacking of Flight 11 (see (8:37 a.m.) September 11, 2001), personnel there initially mistake the hijacking for a simulation as part of an exercise.
[Source: Mary Schwalm / North Andover Eagle-Tribune] The air traffic control tower at Logan International Airport in Boston is called by the FAA's Boston Center and told that communication with Flight 11 has been lost, but when the tower supervisor looks at the plane through his binoculars, he can see nothing outwardly wrong with it.

the worst airline out there no matter how you stack it up worst airline in the country probaly the world... my daughter was 2 min. late to check in this morning getting to her plane..it's noow been 2hrs. and many rude gate employee's later.
there are a lot of people looking for better business for the airline where you can spend little money on their holidays.
they always keep you abreast on what is going on and i find that to be way out of the ordinary compared to all the other airlines.
they didnot put more flights in order to solve the peoples problems (although they saved a lot of money by not flying some flights...). el-al as an example --sent 2 empty planes after 1-2 days and took back free of charge all their customers. they preffered to deal with the few who will take them later to court then to add 1-2 flights to their schdual like el-al did.
this morning ALL continental flights from houston were directed to college station, tx due to fog. the airport in college station is no where near adequate to handle this number of flights and passengers. as a result of this awful decision, passengers from college station became the victims. many were flying to interviews and family events, and were discarded in order to re-route the houston passengers. my girlfriends flight at 12 was pushed to 2, 4, and then 9:30 causing her to miss a rehearsal dinner for a friend's wedding. this decision was ignorant and so unprofessional.

vouchers where you go to the airport and give them your name, and if there?s any room on the flight, you?re golden.
we always choose the earlier flights, even though that usually means spending more because the buses don't run early enough to get to the airport for 7am or earlier flights, so we have to take a car service ($60 extra at least!)!

 look at this. it is the problem i have with kubuntu/ubuntu
 oopd
 sorry about that
 this is the screen i get when i load kubuntu
 http://free.hostdepartment.com/a/alphacentaurihq/brokensrc2.JPG
 i cant get into kde or gnome
 i've tried many versions of ubuntu/kubuntu
 and always have the same problem
 :/
 is that jpg a pure grey ?
 i have excluded the possibility of monitor incompatibility. i've loaded the live CD on another comp and pluged my monitor on it - it worked
 well, brown-grey?
 hum? there is blue on that jpeg
 So it's bound to be a video card thing then?
 it may be the cause
 it can't be much else :)
 i got an ati sapphire radeon 9200 SE
 it's a dirty hack but have you tried putting Driver "vesa" into /etc/X11/xorg.conf in place of whatever driver your radeon usually uses?
 I don't even know if that file gets auto-rebuilt each bootup...
 all gfx cards should work with the 'vesa' driver.. you'll just not get any acceleration.. but it will at least let you 'get in' and start finding the real cause of the problem
 it'll be in 'Section "Device"' about half way into the file
 i think i can get in a shell
 console*
 could i try from there?
 yep you can always ctrl-alt-f2 and just use nano to edit the file...
 then /etc/init.d/kdm restart
 (or just ssh in from another machine?)
 i cannot use ctrl-alt-f2 from what i have, i can boot from the recovery mode and get a console
 so the video fault causes the whole machine to hang?
 the only thing i can do from there is to move the cursor over that broken background
 Oh so you can see the X mouse cursor?
 yes, you can see it on the photo too
 i can move it and see it clearly, but cannot do anything else
 All I see is a grey page with a 'Website brought  to you by free web hosting'
 http://free.hostdepartment.com/a/alphacentaurihq/brokensrc2.JPG at that page?

 i just sent it
 k, greylisting will block it for a while
 Aghaster: boy that's fucked up :)
 Definately try the vesa driver thing
 ok
 lemme reboot and try this
 hi again
 im on my other comp
 i got a console opened on my kubuntu comp
 could u plz just tell me again where is located the file to edit^?
 gdh
 Aghaster: what are you looking to do?
 i got a serious problem and it may be caused by the video driver
 gdh suggested to change the video driver to vesa
 oh hi
 where is the file^?
 it's /etc/X11/xorg.conf
 ok
 Vesa is very generic; might work.
 yup
 i dont see the line where i can change the video driver
 Go to Section "Device"
 ah

 are you in #kubuntu   and  #ubuntu at the some time :o
 Erm, yeah...

 Modern technology, eh?
 but noone anserd me in that chanbbel :(
 here they say to change the driver to radeon
 yeah
 ok
 for the 9200 pro, maybe its the same for the 9200 SE
 John6000: that doesn't really justify going into the wrong channel for your question. ;)
 ok
 thanks anyway
 Aghaster: VESA is a very very basic driver that everything works with.
 yeah
 i agree
 VESA 2.0
 If it works, then you've found some subtle incompatibility with your card / chip
 then take the problem to the X.org people
 since it's their domain
 ok
 and while your at it get me a bourbon
 lol
 me too
 John6000: I was talking to Aghaster  :)
 actually
 custart cream

 It's just cheep lager tonight.. if I have any whisky, I'll be asleep soon after =)

 nice!
 All balanced against word of mouth / good karma etc.
 vesa got it to work
 i ogt a visa
 Aghaster: type 'man radeon' then and start to work through some of the Options
 oneof them will probably make your card work properly
 ok
 If not, write to the X.org people, because this has zero to do with (k)ubuntu
 Aghaster, you gotta problem installing the ati radeon driver or something?
 in fact if you DO get it to work with an Option, tell the X.org people anyway so they can put it in as a default for your PCI ID/vendor/product
 hum... the 9200SE is listed in the radeon
 i will try again to be sure it doesnt work with "radeon"

 "radeon" does not seem to work
 i will put back vesa and manually install driver
 Is there an 'ati' driver too? Or is that only for old RAGE 3D cards
 ?
 ati was the one by default
 well, for now i reinstall ( the one installed was ubuntu, i want kubuntu )
 =)
 Aghaster: It's only a different default setup
 yah, the core is the same... KDE and GNOME sit way above any X / driver config.
 i had the same problem with both ubuntu and kubuntu
 might be worth looking in your /var/log/Xorg.0.log for any "EE" lines...
 hello i del root user, how i do to create new root user . thanks ...
 hum... i dunno
 maybe someone else knows
 i can't create a new root user because root user not exist and i haven't permissions for do this.
 how on earth did you manage to do that? :D
 that takes talent.
 well
 I feel a song coming on....
 did u try to boot in recovery mode?
 ;o(
 recovery mode goes by default in root mode
 in kubuntu you should be able to get a root shell by doing 'sudo bash'
 and type in your own user password (not root pass)
 then you can try something like "adduser --uid 0 root"
 ( a complete guess)
 very thanks gdh
 hey i got a question - do the ubuntu/kubuntu creators are african?
 Aghaster: no
 i dont know much ppl from there, oh...
 I doubt it - just levering on the concept of a 'simpler way of life' I guess?
 Lots of community involvement, etc.
 i like the concept of ubuntu
 it looks like the true spirit of open source community
 Of course - the marketing worked :)
 I'm just a cynic =)
 hey gdh do you know where can i download the wallpaper with the 3 persons in a circle as on the ubuntu main page?
 i like it
 No idea, I have a solid colour background
 KDE looks tacky quickly if you add too much fluff.
 k
 There's apparently been some flamewar raging about that pic... something about being able to see down the woman's cleavage..
 some people need to relax =)
 heh
 I like the standard kubuntu background myself. nice, clean and not overdone.
 hahaha
 anyone know when or if the menu editor option on the gear right click is gonna be fixed or has been fixed?
 not yet.
 LeeJunFan, that for me?
 delltony:  don't understand how something so simple could go unfixed for so long.
 delltony: yeah.
 kmenuedit that hard ? ;)
 haha no its not
 but if its not to be used why not just take it off the list all together
 its like having a door on your car that never opens
 :)
 delltony: I don't like fords either.
 :)
 or having 19 bucks in your bank account and an atm card
 its worthless
 delltony: you can also right click on a menu item and hit edit, that also opens kmenuedit...
 yep
 that i know
 but i was talking about the specific gear option
 oh, ok :)
 oh and when or is it ever gonna happen that kmixer will be configurable?
 meaning i need to change it to control pcm instead of master
 cuse master doesn't do jack on my lappy
 delltony: LOL, I have three doors on my car which don't unlock properly :)
 delltony: Unbelievable PITA
 but not enough to go and get it fixed =)
 well you have nothing on my redneck buddy
 this dude i swear to god get this
 Anywya, be grateful there's a menu editor at all.. the GNOME Ubuntu users have nothing except a text editor and fucked-up XML files
 his truck got hit on the door side right, so he got a new door for his truck but was having trouble getting it to align up right
 so he made him a temp door out of cardboard and duct tape
 haha
 I like that :)
 you pull the duct tape and open it up
 gdh: yeah, and they bash KDE at every chance they get. Yet gnome scares away possible linux converts - children run from it crying.
 I had a 'Pentium 75 in a cardboard box' for a while..
 get in and close it with the duct tape
 haha
 but that beats it =)
 man this dude bowls with me right
 LeeJunFan: I tried GNOME again for the last 2 weeks.. I try it maybe once a year... and every time I come back to KDE...
 you know bowling as in knock down pins and stuff
 well this foo comes up in there with a milk crate
 thats his bowling bag
 haha
 gdh: yeah, I gave up on trying it about 2 yrs ago.
 LeeJunFan: GNOME is TOO PRESET... someone with FAR more intelligence than you has pre-determined every option you will want, and provides no options to change it.
 delltony: hehe
 pretty cool what he did though
 he got some pvc pipe made him a handle
 and put some of those training wheels off a bike on it
 and puts his ball in it
 haha
 People criticise KDE for being bewildering with config and checkboxes, but I'd much rather have the choice.
 If I wanted to be spoon fed I'd buy a Mac.
 delltony: ROTFLMFAO
 gdh, regardless of what it is you always have someone wanting to bitch period
 delltony: amen =)
 i use to be a manager at a retail store, and folks complain about stuff being FREE
 free your giving it to them
 and they bitch
 whats with that
 because they can
 that's why =)
 pretty much
 its like that lady that called 911
 real tape and all right
 they had it on the news
 called complaining that burger king would not make her a cheeseburger right
 and wanted the cops to come down there
 haha
 gdh: yep, I love linux for what it can do, I love the shell and kde both for what they can, but I hate gnome for what it cant.
 great stuff - isn't America just grat? :)
 +e
 man it's notn just america
 i have been over in germany and other places in the world
 delltony: people like that scare me. Just how would they react if they had a real issue?
 LeeJunFan: They'd get their therapist to intervene
 they'll have their personal cellphone number on a speed-dial, no doubt
 like the quote goes their are two things that are infinate (space and human stupidity)
 there even
 lol delltony :P
 I think you struck yourself down with that quote :P
 This town is full of stupid people and they all have to come to me with their problems. hehe
 There are only 10 types of people, those who understand binary and those who don't :)
 maybe but that come from einstin (spelling)
 einstein :)
 yeah him too
 Why is the default skin with beep-media-player so unbelievably shit?
=== buga is now known as buga-away
 has anyone been able to mount samba shares from the cmdline?
 $ mount -t smbfs -o guest //eddie/mp3 /mnt/mp3
 dmesg says: smbfs: mount_data version 1936029031 is not supported
 that'sa new one on me
 hi again
 i'm on kubuntu
 hmmm there's an option to send a program to the desktop ...but how do you do it ?
 smbfs: mount_data version 1718515050 is not supported
 and I'm running my own compiled kernel - so it's got to be a samba bug.
 Shit one..
 am running a dist-upgrade at the moment.. will see if that makes any difference
 membreya: from where? The menu? Right-click..
 nevermind, I've found the option :)
 LeeJunFan: Oh, ffs... smbfs nor smbclient aren't installed... what a stupidly cryptic error :|||
:(
 membreya: for the shortcut?
 do anyone knows how to setup the root password?
 aghaster: yes, but why do you want to?
 advanced :)
 aghaster: You don't use a root password, your own user account has full 'sudo' rights
 It reduces the temptation to log in as root. bad bad bad.
 gdh: shit. And I just filed a bug-report :)
 LeeJunFan: I'd update it with "WTF?!?!" or something similarly productive :)
 root@plip:~# mount /mnt/mp3/
 Anonymous login successful
 works likea charm now
 ah
 but do i have to type sudo each time?
 aghaster: yes. (or 'sudo bash' for  a rootshell...)
 typing su and then typing password is simple
 aghaster: Nope. If you're going to do many sudo commands, just do sudo -s
 ah ok
 or the other one :P
 or that :)
 haha
 snap
 (I've never used sudo before coming to Ubuntu...)
 noob question... but where can i access the "home" folder?
 Same here. Disliked it at first, then it grew on me, and now I think it's a better way of handling things for Desktop PCs, by a long-shot.
 aghaster: /home
 aghaster: second icon from the left
 then top of that list
 ah good
 i.e. beside the K button
 hum... rpm -i seem not to work
 I'd hope not
 take your rpms back to mandrakeworld thanks :)
 how do i install rpms?
 aghaster: man alien
 ok
 apokryphos: That's asking for a fall :)
 Man pages are a good place to start on Linux, I think.
 :P
 aghaster: If you want to get to know Linux, then I recommend searching a few guides. The beginning of http://www.icon.co.za/~psheer/book/index.html.gz is very good; there are other decent ones for command line etc.
 i'm quite novice, its only because i was used to fedora core 3
 Debian-based dists are much better... there's generally no need or risk from crap like rpmfind.net
 you don't just 'get an rpm' - the upstream will have alreay prepared high-quality packages for you
 Precisely. The only stuff I've ever installed so far has been either themes from kde-look, or CVS.
 i didnt like fedora core 3 for managing too much things for me
 has anybody here tried autopackage? i have... and it seems to have killed my internet connection
 i can only access my router
 kubuntu seems to be the true spirit of linux, and is quite a light distro
 FC is a RedHate legacy - it's going to carry a lot of baggage with that
 Kubuntu discs can be ordered, like Ubuntu, right? heh..
 thats why i dont use it anymore
 cool =)
 Bukkake: yes, but not yet.
 oh, okies, thanks
 aghaster: I'm x-FC3 myself. It was a decent distro, but there's more power on Ubuntu, it's more pacey (for me), and Deb-based system is superior easily IMO.
 yep
 Besides, any distro which prides itself on a major change every 6 months needs serious thought...
 i've tried many distros
 but i think i just found the one that is for me
 :)
 kubuntu and knoppix for me
 major change...
 Kubuntu is going to be an option on the "shippit" site for hoary?
 Is anyone here actually part of the Kubuntu devels?
 gdh: they're all here, but not talking.
 oki...
 Just wanted to rant about KIOSlaves and media players again =)
 i'm interested in linux environment C++ programming
 i will learn how to use "make"
 and makefiles
 That's a good start :)
 maybe one day i'll get good enough to do some linux development...
 but that day may be far away
 In the meantime, go write code for the GNOME crowd :)
 well, i'm on KDE
 hehe yes I know =) never mind =)
 do you know a tutorial on linux programming environment?
 I'm not a coder, programming bores me... I'm a systems geek
 ah ok
 I do some shell and bad Perl, but that's about it.
 my dream is to become a 1337 coder
 and to program games
 hahhahahahah
 Cool :)
 well, everyone has dreams
 i'm only 16 so i got plenty of time
 well make sure to drink lots of alcohol, go to lan parties, have an uncapped cable modem, and hack a gibson
 all across state lines
 lol, hack a gibson as in the movie hackers :P
 nono a gibson as in www.grc.com (no, not the mounties :)
 that is the prerequisite for being 1337
 :P
 gdh where are you from?
 Originally from Belfast in Northern Ireland (hello moominski :) but I live in England now
 hi i have ubuntu installed but i want to get kubuntu aswell can u help me ?
 i'm from quebec
 moominski: I already gave you the link. :)
 bout ye feckin great
 aghaster: I recogise videotron :)
 lol
 moominski: :D
 im a noob soz
 sweet m8 happy days
 moominski: There's a HOWTO on the go about how to install KDE... after all Ubuntu and Kubuntu are the same core
 jsut different UI packages
 gdh: I gave him the URL, I guess he didn't want to click. ;)
 :P
 yeah i understand there difference m8 i just like kde is all
 moominski: I can understand not wanting to download another ISO.. after all that's one CD less off your ntl monthly warez cap, right? :)
 gdh:  is trying to articulate that it shouldn't be any trouble at all
 just read the faq
 hey i got problems reading audio CD
 lol m8
 i dotn give a hoots i just download wot i want
 moominski: your superior intellect renders me incapable of communicating with you
 Forgive the local dialect =)
 wy dude im just a stoner
 No shit =)
 haha
 man it keeps sayin this E: Couldn't find package kubuntu-desktop
 moominski: you're not readin the link :)
 i did
 http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/InstallingKDE
 You really didn't. It specifically says -- at the very top -- that if you have Warty you can only get kde 3.2, in which case you want the kde-core package
 *not* the kubuntu-desktop one
 The lines are thin but they are there :) try looking just in between them :)
 well that all very confusin to me m8
 lol
 I'd try again in the morning, tbh
 Confusing? Erm, how? I couldn't dream of that part in plainer language. :)
 gdh r u allways on here m8
 this is my first time (oo-er)
 debian geek for ages - first time I've use ubuntu
 wot do u think
 am just sitting drinking and playing crap tunes
 I installed Kubuntu to start with :)
 i didnt even no it was out there
 only new about ubuntu
 Aye, that'd KDE always playing second fiddle
 only started usin linux the otherday
 Ahh... Kubuntu is still a bit rough round the edges
 indeed
 so now and again it'll need some Linux knowledge to dip into...
 its im sure i wud hardly notice
 stoned and cant type
 moominski: to get really into your distro, and be able to do things, it's really worth looking through a few basic Linux guides. They really help.
 Linux can be daunting, but understood with diligence.
 i have been ive read loads of stuff i just keep trying to do things on linux the way i do on windows
 moominski: well, keep at it ;). We're here to help, too. :)
 E: Package kde-core has no installation candidate
 get this now
 moominski: not reading :P
 in Warty, you have to enable the Universe repository first.
 omg im really tha dumb am i
 moominski: Seriously, if your head is on the moon, try again in the morning =)
 lol
 I recommend upgrading to hoary though; kde 3.2 is quite dated.
 need a smoke , btw i dont go to bed im a stoner told ya
 i did upgrade to hoary
 No, you haven't. :P
 i must have it
 well, cat /etc/issue then
 does GCC comes with kubuntu?
 hmm now how did that happen
 aghaster: repositories. Go for the build-essential package.
 hum?
 moominski: you installed warty. :)
 so its not?
 aghaster: nope, it's not.
 huh, that program should be included with the distro
 but 98% of the stuff you need for general building is in that package
 ok now how do i get hoary
 moom: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/hoary/preview/hoary-install-i386.iso
 moominski: that link I gave was very useful ;)
 600M
 download and go to bed :)
 gdh: no point, if he's already got warty.
 OKi, fair enough
 moominski: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/GuideToHoary
 k
 rite wots the command to gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
 yep, that's it :)
 you probably want to 'sudo' before that, though.
 u guys where lettin me do the work formyself
 just gotta read dont ya
 Nothing quite like free software, eh? :)
 all self-service =)
 wots the command to edit that file

 or whatever editor you prefer.. gedit would've been fine
 (assuming it was installed :)
 yes but i dont no the command to edit it i can only get read only
 anybody know what the "malformed url" shortcut on the quicklauncher is from?
 you have to manually add the quicklauncher to a panel... i prefer the smaller icons on it
 moominski: you need to prefix the command with "sudo"
 that will get you root access
 hey all... I just dist-upgraded my father's Kubuntu system (there was like 130 new packages...) and all of the sudden the whole panel is missing all the application lunchers etc. (like the K button in the left lower corner) Any ideas what happened ?
 Wurstmeister: there's problems with the current packages. Bad time to dist-upgrade ;)
 hehe
 oh?
 it's not my box :)
 unfortunately you'll have to add all that stuff manually, though it's not much :P
 I did
 most of it at least
 will wait until apr 6th :)
 will do
 gdh: It's a few things; nothing critical. A few .kde settings, and kicker stuff.
 gdh: or just until end of month, if you like :P. RC.
 Hopefully it'll get fixed next time I'll do dist-upgrade
 Cool. I hope someone notices my little plea on the SuggestedPackages Wiki page for the Pocket PC Konnector =)
 Wurstmeister: Yup; should be fine. I do loads of dist-upgrades, and this is the first time I've encountered problems with it, ever.
 that'd be so good to have - it's nearly impossible to compile afterwards since it needs to many -dev packages that don't exist :)
 gdh: they will probably, eventually. ;)
 That's fine
 apokryphos: That's it, I'm just doing what I can to influence future events :)
 man i can get into that file
 I ssh-ed to my father's box and did dist-upgrade... he called me and said WTF has happened to his Kicker :)
 hehe
 Wurstmeister: Wow, my dad would've said something like 'my windows is broken'
 Well :) I installed Kubuntu on his box the next day it came out
 wanted him to experience LINUX :)
 got a xorg issue here (I assume)-- is anyone having a problem with desktop background gradients-- or any kde wallpaper using gradients-- looking awful?
 he's cool with trying new things
 other visuals look fine
 hi
 what package are alternative keyboard layouts in?
 I don't have /any/ listed here...
 yeah i do smouche, i restart the xserver and everything is fine
 Wurstmeister: a very good choice :). I hope he likes it.
 well...things are being worked on..I told him that this is developer's cutting edge stuff and he'll have to wait till the final release
 incubii, this happens every time-- it seems permanent for me.  Restarting doesn't help
 unless I'm missing something
 Wurstmeister: nice ;)
 He's PC illiterate
 heh
 why expose him to windows  :) ?
 Evil
 I like it :)
 well he's dual botting win2000
 Ah the dirty truth falls out =)
 oh well mine only lasts till i restart the xserver, but every time i reboot ti comes back. one solution was to set a modeline in teh config but alas taht does nto do anything for me
 He's getting away from win2k more and more
 definately play up the whole security / privacy / spyware thing =)
 I just need to make sure that he can watch those stupid little wmv clips
 Mplayer plugins will be installed shortly
 hmm, thanks for replying incubii.  A mystery, eh?  Could this have something to do with my having a widescreen display?
 yeh if need be you can get the w32codecs package from christian marillat's debian repository..
 yup
 I'm sure they'll be fine with Ub...
 that is what I use
 Wurstmeister: hehe. Yup; have you checked thew iki article?
 well i guess its possivle
 ok, cool.
 I run Sarge here
 got all the plugins
 might wanna post in the forums and see what you get
 Qool
 i ran sarge on my G4. it was such a complete mess
 mozplugger is giving me some probs once in a while
 the installer was lovely though
 Hah, it should get a good review from the Linux paper magazines then
 since all they ever compare on is how pretty the installer is and if it detected all their hardware
 the one thing the ubuntu installer needs is adding the proxy question like the sarge one did
 People still use proxies thesedays? How quaint :)
 we do at work
 saves DLing the same thing 200 times
 Sounds like a good case for a PXE boot image :)
 Ubuntu is very nice
 im working on that actually
 Kubuntu as well
 but then we need a gigabit network
 as that would be too many machines
 I will drop it on my other box
 when the final is out
 incubii: I run a Linux call centre - as long as your switches have gbit you're OK :)
 each w/s only needs 100mbit
 since 12MB/sec is perfectly adequate.
 how many machines run through the switch
 everything is diskless + NFS/NIS based...
 sweet
 We're a small outfit.. only 30 Linux clients on one 1Gbit NIC at the server
 well i want to do that but unfortunatly they still want windows here
 I should really plug the second in and do some resilience...
 that an OS X but thats another story
 Unless you get all machine wanting to reboot at the same time, there's no speed drop ever
 thinking of doing OS X the PXE way
 but the problem with PXE boot is if the server goes down thats it
 v. true :)
 though with my workplace id have 3 servers for redundancy
 We have a pair of machines and each is configured to be ready to take over the task of the other if need be
 maybe 10-20 mins of frantic typing on my behalf then we're back up
 ah! a smart work place
 not an auto-failover, but not bad :)
 glad ours isnt the only one
 lol
 I'm scaring myself at the moment with OSPF and load-balancing...
 yeah atuo-failover is so nice when ti works
 It's all just very slightly above my head, but I can bluff it OK so that's all that matters =)
 heh
 i had to take over this place from a previous ghost image server
 it was horrible
 47 different machine images to manage
 fuck that
 eech
 We have 'Shuttle' PCs all on one shared NFS root image.
 converted the whol windows section to Unattended Network Install
 much much better now
 anyone using kxkb for different keyboard layouts?  How come no extra keyboard layouts are listed for me??
 Roey: No, none of us have weird keyboards :)
 i want to try a dvorak kb
 Wow that'd be a mindfuck =)
 they are meant to be more natural arent they ?
 once you get use to them
 they're not
 there's no difference in typing speed, it's all myth.
 Yeh in the same way that your eyes actually get an upside down image but your brain reverses it...
 How can I find my kernel version from the command line?
 uname -a
 heh i watched a science show where at one uni they were putting headsets on people and reversing the image so when they took it off people saw upside down as normal
 incubii: I saw that :)
 I'm having a helluva time getting the "us-intl" (us with dead keys) layout to work write.  And switching layouts seems to screw things up.  This stuff if much easier in windows
 incubii: the folklore story on that topic I heard was of a guy who wore 'upside down' glasses until his brain flipped the image.. then took them off.. until his brain corrected..
 and repeated this... until he had a mental breakdown
 heh heh, "work write"
 lol
 see, I can't even type.  Fucking layouts!
 Who cares if it's true or not- it's still funny :)
 um
 i just run xorgconfig, smouche
 do you guys SEE any layouts??
 well i dont need any diff layout from 101 generic us
 incubii -- any improvements?
 I haven't run xorgconfig
 so I have 2.6.10-5 and it isn't available in the repository?  hrm...
 well soemtimes when i install my USB mouse is recognised so i run that to set it. even though its just as easy to edit xorg.conf ,lol
 isnt*
 I need my dead keys, dammit.  But I also need apostrophes.  I don't know how any body who uses more than one language copes with linux.  But I'm an ignorant noob, I know...
 Linux is only a front for America to take over even more of the free-thinking world :)
 discuss =)
 any kde guru's? i'm trying to get konqueror to use my specific font only.. and i think i need to do it using the custom stylesheet option.. any help would be appreciated
 gdh: *cough* finland *cough*
 There is #kde
 Bah it's all just a cover operation for the TRUE cause ;)
 i lost internet access after an autopackage installation... can anybody help me get it back? i am not getting much help from the #autopackage community... apparently i am an anomaly
 What pisses me off though, is that there are Englsih speakers who may have occasion to at least quote something in another language -- but the folks who set a lot of standards seem to have been relentlessly monolingual
 i just want internet back on my desktop:-(
 shit. Englsih speakers, heh, I am one, believe it or not.  This keyboard is larger than the one I'm used to...
 smouche: I'll certainly admit that I miss the Windows style of being able to do common accents on a US/UK keyboard by Ctrl-Alt-E etc.
 I have absolutely no idea how to do accented characters in Linux
 id help you if i knew what autopackage was
 my favorite thoughtless English chauvinist idiocy is the use of CamelCase for wikis -- how the hell do Germans cope with that?
 Yeh, I've never heard of autopackage
 smouche: That statement means nothing whatsoever to me, sorry :|
 CamelCase IsNot ProperEnglish
 gdh, the US-International keyboard for windows is the greatest invention since sliced bread.
 autopackage.org ... you'll be redirected to a random mirror due to the recent slashdotting
 a popular Python-based wiki is MoinMoin, written by a german
 i first heard about it when gaim provided a .package installation
 we use moinmoin at work
 gdh, German requires Capitalization for every Noun.  CamelCased wiki names don't work well for that.
 Ah, only one step away from Microsoft's lngHungarianNotation
 yuck i hate hungarian notation
 amen :)
 but at the moment... i can access my router on my network... i just can't get past it to the internet
 so i can't ping google.com or anything
 have you set your gateway to the router ip
 it happened after doing an autopackage of firefox 1.0.2 ... i just want to fix it
 so when I name a variable isThisStupid, does God kill a puppy?
 everything looks normal in ifconfig
 depends is the Puppy of type Integer
 regeya: three, actually.
 HI
 gah!
 Either 1) you should inherently KNOW asa coder what the type is..
 what are the nvidia packages for kubuntu, besides nvidia-glx ?
 GodKillsPuppiesNoMatterWhatYouDoRegeya
 or. 2) it shouldn't MATTER to the language.
 what are the nvidia packages for xorg?
 i cant be arse making my current kubuntu work. KDE just stops at initiaizing peripherals
 Roey: apt-cache search nvidia turns up a lot of things...
 hey... it crawls for me there too
 including the 'linux-restricted-modules' packages
 initializing peripherals slows way down
 (probably from multiverse)
 the problem with hungarian notation is non-english people have a hard time reading the variable names and functions etc
 yeah, incubii-- it kind of hangs on peripherals for me too, but eventually makes it.  I avoid the whole thing most of the time by just hibernating.
 gdh:  I'VE LOOKED.
 well it worked the first install
 gdh:  I isntalled nvidia-glx
 gdh:  but that's just for the kernel.
 but everyone after that fails there
 gdh:  not X.
 gdh:  not xorg rather.
 nto really important though, after all it is only a preview release
 what annoyed me more was i couldnt watch DVDs but i could use the DVD burner to burn them
 :D
 Sometimes, it just skips starting my touchpad altogether.  Fortunately there's a switch on this laptop that'll start it.  Usually.
 Roey: Are you sure?
 roey: nvidia-glx contains the file ./usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers/nvidia_drv.o
 amongst many others
 i do get a no ipv6 routers present message when i run dmesg
 where do i download Dependencies
 gdh:  hmm.
 gdh:  oh, it's the kernel modules, sorry
 =)
 gdh:  right..see, I installed 7791 through the nvidia package manager
 gdh:  and now I have 7791 (7167 rather, sorry)
 gdh:  on Xorg
 er
 It's a bit out of my league - my computer has an old Matrox PCI Mystique :)
 7167 on the kernel
 and 6691 on xorg.
 but yeh the mismatched versions will be fatal =)
 hurray for closed source drivers, eh?
 i like binary drivers
 we need more of them

 i.e. they daren't show us how many software patches are needed to work around bugs in the buggy hardware they had to rush out the door to beat ATI. :)
 smouche:  they're fucked in the head.
 anyhow,
 GNOME people are generally paying rent to live up their own backsides
 smouche: Heh. Debaticles in there are funny; very rarely get heated, which is good.
 Roey:   but still capable of talking and feeding themselves...
 it's all a tax dodge
 smouche:  I know, it's ironic.
 moominski: apt/synaptic
 smouche:  so where is the Kernel module for nvidia located?
 yeh I've only just noticed the tiem...
 night, all =)
 like I know, Roey?  sorry!
 nitee
 ok
 so change it to a 12 hour clock
 lol
 yes
 im use to 24 hour
 same here.
 kubuntu ppc should come with an smp kernel on the cd
 I believe the 12-24 hour thing is linked to region, so if you're from, say, USia and have your lang set to en_US it should be 12-hour
 pepsi, I can't find an option for that.  Not in the "configure clock" dialog, anyway
 though I dunno
 right click on it and go to Preferences
 oh shit
 this is #kubuntu
 well, it seems like I set the region about 8 times already, but I'll try again
 lol
 so i dunno
 its probably something similar though :D
 yeah, set to Eastern Time.  There's no option here for 12 hour format, at least in the panel clock applet
 the only thing I know of is changing your region
 yeah set it to australia
 you know you want to
 'course I could use "fuzzy clock"... ;-)
 Country/Region & Language
 or alternatively
 if you're in a region that defaults to 24-hour time
 or right click on the clock applet and click "Date & Time Format"
 in that same entry, you can change it under the time & dates tab
 or that
 :-}
 or just learn 24 hour time
 ;)
 gets you to the same panel!  teehee
 omni_lonnie -- that must be the options screen I missed.
 Seems to me all that stuff should be available under "configure clock"
 yep, but it's there :)
 you know the installer should say "updating apt repositories" instaled of "testing network repository"
 instead*
 anyway, thanks omni_lonnie --
 no prob
 I have to guess at the settings, and I think the panel needs to be restarted to even see the changes...
 yes
 I'm guessing you want 12-hour.  there's an option labeled 'pH:MM:SS AMPM'
 clear as mud
 yeah, that's it...
 and yeah, the clock has to be restarted...
 thanks folks!
 actually, what I'd really like is to have more than one clock in a panel, with different time zones, but I'm assuming those settings are global only...
 actually, you can have dofferent time zones on different clocks
 just right click on one and choose "Show Timezone".  Each clock applet can be set seperately!
 hey, youe right -- cool!
 ooops, damn dead keys...
 kde is just too damn fun to fiddle with... amazing how much stuff I can run on here with 512 megs ram.  Now, if only there were an applet to force me to get my work done...
 kde is fun?
 you should check out gnom.
 gnome even.
 it looks way cooler.
 smouche: unfortunately I have the same problem ;)
 Well, then difekta, we won't try to make you difekt.
 difekta means "broken"
 it's esperanto.  similar to the word "defective".
 Once I turned off the freakin' bouncing cursors, I was very happy.
 difekta: obviously - you're using gnome :p
 kde seems way overdone and windows-like.
 Windows?  if only wondows was this cool!
 lemme try it again though and see whether it's gotten better.. /me goes to another xterm.
 -windows
 difekta: gnome seems undone and childlike.
 it just looks way windows-like.
 i don't see that at all.
 it's way more sleek and refined looking.
 lemme log into kde here..
 It's nothing like windows.
 oh it's soooo like windows.
 difekta: how do you edit menu's again?
 edit menus?
 difekta: in gnome?
 hah hah!
 good point, LeeJunFan
 well, it has windows, icons, a "start menu", a "trash can" and a lot more...
 you mean the menu in the task bar?
 /usr/share/applications/*.desktop
 difekta: yeah.
 freedesktop guidelines.
 oh, wait that is mac like too...
 and gnome like too ;)
 i think gnome is way more mac-like.  aesthetic, pleasing to the eye.  sophisticated.
 personally I can't stand the mac granny look n feel.
 umm ok, but this is the *k*ubuntu channel ;)
 doh..i don't have kde.
 it looks so sleek and futuristic.
 People let too much ride on how a distro looks "out of the box".
 woah..half a gig?  forget that.
 i toyed with kde.  it has all of these way commercial feeling look-and-feel theme choosing options.
 it's terrible.  it feels so plasticy and commercialized.
 difekta: yeah, that size comes from features like a menu editor. :)
 you can edit the menu in gnome just fine.
 difekta: and a mac doesn't?
 helloo again
 no.
 smouche: I agree.  I *always* customize the desktop I'm using no mater what it is...
 okay, the "plastic" theme is absolutely atrocious.
 kde is far less confusing for a new linux user, not because it's "like windows" but because (most of) the menus etc are self-explanatory, many of the applets work a lot better, it's just less aggravating to learn how to use...
 imho
 i don't like gnome spatial file management by default... and is there an easy way to edit window settings in gnome?
 like eliminating the border
 dimmak, don't know, I dropped gnome for kde -- try the #ubuntu channel.
 dimmak: last time I used gnome you couldn't even chose fonts w/o some cryptic string/name.
 kde has more potential to get cluttered up
 but i prefer it
 but dimmak, I think you need to look at the metacity or nautilus settings buried in gconfig.
 i don't plan on touching gnome for a while... i was just interested
 i prefer KDE
 gnome jsut prohibits me from doing anything
 The latest version of kde seems like a gigantic improvement over ones I tried before, and the (k)ubuntu packaging was very very good
 LeeJunFan: erm font chooser looks roughly like kde's
 I detest that gconfig thing in gnome.  How's a new user even supposed to know that they have to look at the settings for "metacity", buried in with all other apps, just so they can alter window behaviour?
 LeeJunFan: so maybe you haven't used gnome in many years?
 smouche: they aren't supposed to use gconf-editor
 I mean shit, a new user doesn't even know what "metacity" is.
 calc: yeah, I know it's been a while. I used to be hardcore anti qpl license, so I stuck it with gnome for a long time. But when qt relaxed a bit I was able to like kde better.
 the part they are supposed to modify is exposed in preferences options
window
 I couldn't find anything in those (awful) gnome menus that I *was* supposed to use, though, calc
 smouche: not my fault you are illiterate :)
 but I always hated gnomes rough edges and lack of standard features, etc... I'm gonna give it a try on one of my other systems in the next couple days - the live demo, just to check it out.
 that's gnome elitism all the way... ;-)  Actually, I know there's a "gnome control panel", but when I tried gnome warty, inexplicably it didn't appear in any menus.  Just gconfig.
 well i am gonna play around with ndiswrapper... see you llater
 LeeJunFan: i was the same way but found kde very lacking in consistency so switched back to gnome
 perhaps kubuntu fixed the problems with kde upstream
 gnome cant use my dialup
 i have to dial from the console
 :D
 that was broken for many years on kde as well
 at least in debian
 primarily i guess since no developers used dialup
 man i feel for folks that use dialup now days
 ha 28.8kb i use 1000kb up and down a dedicated server :D
 we have 2mb/2mb at work
 that i continaully flat line
 lol
 i used to have 8000/640
 I've got 4down/2up.
 i gotta get my porn fast :)
 we are trying to get 8/8
 which means i get my isos even faster
 :D
 well actually the server i use is not capped
 Good night, one and all, or good morning, or whatever time zone applies, and thanks for the help and hints
 pff clean install of kubuntu and it still hangs on peripherals
 but as long as as i average 1920 a sec then they leave the cap off
 since i haven't been uploading kde in the past few months i haven't really missed fast internet
 so at times ill shoot it thru the roof
 i only have 1000/128 now
 hangs on peripherals...
 ?
 yeah KDE does
 ?
 then it goes away to jsut the background and does nothign else
 1 out of 10 installs has actually worked
 wow...I must have one of those 10
 im on PPC though
 ;)
 heh
 I've installed on about 4 now - all good.
 i dont want it on my PC
 just my duel G4
 I've done a couple amd64's and a couple i386.
 woa its getting there slowly
 omg it appeard
 ow!
 it onyl took 10 mins to load KDE
 :D
 OKAY, I challenge anybody to top this screenshot in KDE : http://brokenladder.com/images/SCREENSHOT.PNG
 incubii: do you have a lo interface?
 eh probably, the nic grabs DHCP assigned ip of the windows 2k3 ICS
 yeah i got lo
 you give up don't you?  that's right.  because gnome owns kde.
 difekta:
 what are we trying to TOP exactly ?
 slackware dropped gnome.
 something that looks that slick.
 no way1
 you have a few windows open
 wow!
 http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/28/009237&from=rss
 with a crud theme
 right.  open windows is what most people do in a gui.
 crud?
 wow, that's an ugly screenie
 it's slick as hell.
 you are insane.
 difekta, http://2sdw.com/images/3-13.png
 pff its an OS X crappy clone
 i have a mac osx wallpaper with an awesome minimalistic slick-ass-hell setup.
 what theme is that shavo
 chavo*
 that's okay i guess.  but the icon theme is silly.
 way overdone.
 difekta, http://2sdw.com/images/2-23.png
 and the kmail logo ruins your whole shot because it's so ugly.
 404 on that one dude.
 i do like the minimalistic aspect of the first shot.
 http://2sdw.com/images/02-23.png
 not as ugly as all those nasty square lesstif looking gtk widgets.
 square looks better.
 there are round gtk things too.
 they still look plain and old.
 lol regeya
 a perfect kde example there.  the title bars have gradients, which look terrible.  and the pop-up menu there has an embossed look.
 likewise
 still loading the first one :D
 instead of just having a flat highlight effect.
 difekta, you can change the look of the menu
 flat is last millenia
 from the control center
 i know that.
 difekta: you'd probably like kde better if it still had the kde1 windowstyles
 no.
 can you do that with any gnome themes.
 kde used to be way uglier.
 kde is just so overdone.
 it needs minimalism.
 its not a minimalistic desktop environment
 if you want that get XFCE or fluxbox
 http://home.earthlink.net/~regeya/shot-20050327.jpg <- heh
 but it should feel light and responsive and not so overdone.
 man my server is slow tonight
 thats like telling me ford should be holden
 difekta: that's what bash is for (minimalism).
 the first screenshot was pretty nice.
 lol.
 that's too minimalistic.
 i think fluxbox looks awesome with the minimalistic theme; but it doesn't have enough functionality.
 http://2sdw.com/images/3-06.png
 well what exactly do you need
 lemme look
 I like my computer to work for me, not the other way around.
 the new kde rocks :) It made me switch
 the soft solid color is better, but the icons look atrocious.
 how new?
 i used kde a couple months ago and it still sucked.
 3.4
 how new is that?
 like 2 weeks
 those icons give me the horny
 oh.  maybe i'll try it out.
 lol regeya
 same screen with diff. icons http://2sdw.com/images/3-06.png
 kde just feels kinda bloated i guess..that's the only way i can describe it.
 anyone here see any keyboard layouts besides English?
 they were windows first, and I think they were "ported" to gnome, then kde...could be remembering wrong
 those are a gnome icon set, ported to KDE by the way.
 I don't ahve any listed when I try to confiure...
 to each his own difekta
 *configure
 excellent!  go away.
 he said "bloated"
 look at all the people that praise windows
 *who praise windows
who
 chavo: shut up asswipe!
 ha ha
 =)
 http://img145.exs.cx/my.php?loc=img145&image=snapshot36zn.jpg
 :)
 hurtsa lot it
 chavo: please tell me you know what I was referencing when I said that :)
 randabis_:  is that an in-game image?
 is that console using alpha transparency or just screenshotting the background ?
 randabis_:  do you have the source at all?
 LeeJunFan, ???
 Beavis and Butthead.
 difekta: I blame Rasterman, but he did it to GTK+, and KDE followed suit.
 LeeJunFan, oh I missed that, sorry.
 Roey, I forgot where I got that picture :/
 randabis_:  can you put it up somewhre?
 difekta: now GNOMErs fight to rewrite history, make GNOME look like the non-l33t non-configurable choice, and make fun of KDE for being as flexible as GNOME once was
 chavo: np. Just didn't want you to think I was attacking you for something.
 difekta: that doesn't excuse KDE devs for crapping up an excellent system, but it's not like they did it first. ;-)
 incubii, that's fake trans in the console. But you can enable real trans by uncommenting some parts of konsole code.
 ah, dont think i will be doing that
 no it doesn't work that well
 besides real transparency all the time makes it too hard to read
 indeed
 I'd like to hurt a few Apple engineers
 heh
 dont hurt the ones that make 30" LCDs
 i like those ones
 transparency, translucency, etc are great.
 just not in a GUI.
 LeeJunFan, I used gnome for a long, long time. But man they just keep mucking it up.
 Roey, http://img237.exs.cx/img237/3031/050129035125593sy.jpg
 regeya: yeah, t-shirts :)
 lol
 hehehe
 randabis_:  thank you!!!
=== randabis_ is now known as randabis
 Roey, np
 you know, on the one hand, there are things that GNOME gets right that Apple and Microsoft get wrong.  that's impressive.
 :)
 on the other hand, they tend to do grand sweeping changes in releases, sometimes without warning, sometimes against popular opinion.
 regeya:  that said, ar eyou using kde now or gnome?
 gnome are like goths
 they conform to non-conformity
 if you start liking it they change it
 incubii: haha
 Roey: kde
 ah, ok
 Roey: though until recently I was giving gnome an extended try
 Bow down to the almighty HIG!
 regeya:  why 'until recently'? what happened that you changed your mind?
 i dont even know what a hig is
 probably the new kde 3.4 :p
 it rocks my socks...I never thought I'd start using kde regularly again
 HIG == The death of Gnome.
 Roey: if I have to resort to the command line more than 45% of the time, it's crap
 To admit - gnome has been a while with me. But last time I tried it was the stupid things that pissed me off about it - I mean how hard is it to line up icons on the taskbar?
 Roey: also, GNOME is t3h slow
 yeah kde pwns gnome in speed now
 I have problems with kde though too
 for example, the menus
 I'm going to look at gnome again tomorrow, but I don't expect I'll be staying, who knows.
 i struggled to create a shortcut in gnome that actually worked
 :D
 and the way that they never have what I need
 indeed chavo; it was annoying for a while, any time a new under-development app was announced on GNOME news, seeing these "it's not HIG compliant" posts
 who cares if it's useful--we gotta fix that HIG compliance FIRST!
 lol
 oh, and esd. Does gnome still use that?
 what I really hate about gnome 2.10 is the way they totally fucked up the networking tool
 you can't even add interfaces with it anymore
 Roey: also, when I posted that screenshot to my freebie Web space a few minutes ago, I went straight from the screenshot app to FTP via the Save dialog
 !
 regeya, you can't beat that.
 excellent
 VFS rocks
 when you get it to work, yeah
 i got my 54g wireless card working with kubuntu via ndiswrapper... a first... thank you kubuntu
 now to get my ipod working on here again
 happy happy joy joy
 anyone else using kubuntu on PPC here?
 incubii: that shouldn't be hard - plug it in and go to media: in konqueror
 doesnt automount LeeJunFan :)
 have to manually mount it
 loads the module for it though
 hey... a few ideas for KDE app names... BuKkake and Konfusion...
 er
 gtkpod works well
 bukkaKe
 lol
 =)
 yeah gtkpod works nicely
 still have to mount the ipod though first
 :P
 oh it automounts now
 sweet
 must of broken my other install somehow then
 incubii: try amarok :)
 i still need an fstab to right click and mount though
 you shouldn't if it's in media:
 I mounted my camera earlier w/o it being in fstab.
 well it errs that there is no entry
 huh, I just checked my camera again.
 hmm well it needs it but then its just a matter of adding it in
 incubii: no fstab, but it's in mtab allright.
 incubii: are you in media:/ ?
 yes
 i click mount on the ipod partition
 and i get
 I wonder what the diff is?
 Please check that the dist is entered correctly"
 disk*
 incubii: have you done updates yet?
 i think i will switch from firefox to knoquerer
 konq*
 nah not yet
 thats tnite
 since im on 28.8kb dialup
 hey
 :P
 where's konq-plugins ?
 incubii: maybe that's it. updates to udev/hal maybe.
 and pykde3
 hehe
 and KEYBORD LAYOUTS :(
 im going to upgrade the kernel tnite
 and KDE some time
 lol
 incubii:  how
 incubii:  what are you going to put on da kernel
 ?
 upgrading to latest kubuntu 2.6 kernel with SMP
 as this kernel is only uni processor from the CD
 :|
 cd doesnt come with smp
 probably one of the slight annoyances that could be fixed for duel ppc systems
 konq didnt like viewing media:/ while i put a dvd in
 :|
 the KDE side image on kubuntu is wrong
 it says 5.4 but should say 5.04 ?
 incubii, never noticed that because I have the side image turned off, but you are right
 what side image?
 on the main kde menu
 mine just says kde3.4
 mine says kubuntu 5.4
 i'm just going to install kde for the hell of it and try it out.
 since you fuckers say it's good.
 My ~ dir is years old - I probably have a diff theme or something.
 ;)
 I'm not really a fucker, but I did stay at a holidy inn express last night.
 LeeJunFan, you can put a custom side image in your ~/.kde somewhere
 lol.
 chavo: not that I've done on purpose. Maybe it's part of an overall theme.
 Mine has KDE 3.4 and a blue Gear in my side/menu.
 did you install KDE through ubuntu or use the kubuntu iso ?
 LeeJunFan, did you install the kubuntu-default-settings package?
 hmm I've got the kubuntu side image here.
 yeah, it's on here.
 I installed from CD about a week ago on this drive, been keeping up to date daily.
 I think my amd64 install (which is way older on another partition) has the same.
 BTW - that login screen - is that really kdm or some bastardization? I can't change anything about it.
 maybe its really GDM in disguise
 incubii: it looks more like it.
 LeeJunFan, it's kdcm
 kdm
 I don't know about that...I've used a custom gdm theme for a while now
 you can theme kdm in 3.4
 ldd /usr/bin/kdm doesn't show a single qt or kde library that it's linked to.
 yellowonblue theme looks scary
 heh
 maybe its static ?
 *it's
 did icon zooming go away?
 dimmak, yes
 oh well
 its there falt its nort werkin
 :P
 but I liked icon zooming :(
 incubii: I can't change my background or any other option on the login via kcontrol - so I'm wondering if kubuntu didn't pull a Mandrake and write their own dm and call it kdm.
 search the forums
 ming be info on it there
 might*
login manager
 LeeJunFan, I can change my kdm here. I've changed the theme. And Mandrake rewrote kdm, they call it mdkkdm
 upgrading udev fixed my KDE bootup troubles
 make sure you sudo
 chavo: not until I bitched about it on the cooker list.
 :D
 or su
 now it boots in 9 seconds
 :O
 LeeJunFan, aha
 loads*
 chavo: first they removed the real kdm.: )
 yes
 I wonder why I can't change my login settings, but then I wonder why you and I have a different menu image too :)
 btw - I created a new user and it has the same image in the menu. So it's not a remnant somehow left from a 3 year old .kde dir.
 LeeJunFan: sudo kcontrol
 hmm now it recognises the ipod as a removeable device but i still cant access it without fstab entry
 dimmak: I did that. I'll try again.
 oh ok
 i just use the control center through the menu
 then it actually has a button for administration mode
 brb - gotta try.
 nice. kaffeine 0.6
 no deal - It changed the passwd echo to 3 star, and the graphic type to keramic (had to make changes everywhere to see what might actually work), but still kubuntu background.
 smooth people. smooth.
 LeeJunFan: the login manager or the splash screen?
 login
 LeeJunFan: the splash screen is under appearance and themes
 in case it might be that
 I get kubuntu background - then the one I chose for login, then my desktop background.
 It loads my chosen background between the login background and the desktop.
 if I check /etc/kde3/kdm/backgroundrc it says Wallpaper=/usr/share/wallpapers/KDE34.png
 LeeJunFan: what are you trying to do?
 change my login background.
 change it in backgrounrc if you don't want to see the default background for a moment while kde loads your chosen background.
 backgroundrc has what I want to show - but that isn't what's showing on the login screen. It only shows for a second while kdm quits and hands over to kwin.
 yah, then you have to set it where dimmak said you should.
 I did.
 Nothing changes the actual BG that's shown while I type in my passwd.
 I think the kubuntu theme is overriding anything I change.
 i haven't played around with it enough then
 /usr/share/apps/kdm/themes/kubuntu
 found it?
 LeeJunFan, it's the theme
 no matter what BG I choose it's the one in there that's shown - with all the buttons.
 for my ipod problem i just put it in fstab and auto mount
 look in /etc/kde3/kdm/kdmrc for UseTheme
 to /mnt/sda2 then softlink it to /mnt/ipod and /media/ipod
 :)
 works nice ly
 yeah, I saw the theme in there. But what buttons will be there if I remove the theme? :)
 it will be a small dialog window
 chavo: that's what I want. :) thanks. No way to change that via GUI?
 that will use the theme you choose in control center
 LeeJunFan, not yet
 there's an app on kde-apps.org but it's still in development
 brb.
 works for me, I changed my theme with it.
 that was it.
 LeeJunFan, you can just start a new session to test the changes you know
 chavo: oh yea, forgot about that. I'm old school :)
 hehe
 OMFG kde is robust as hell.
 who the hell are you and what have you dont to difekta ?
 s/dont/done
 heh
 i just installed kde
 so many apps!
 but i'm still in gnome running them...
 lemme hop over to another xserver.
 alot nicer then 6 months ago hey ?
 kde...robust? :| lol
 it has about 5 times the apps on gnome.
 kde is harvested from only the finest GUI beans :)
 lots of apps yes..but it crashes at least once a day on my computer :P
 especially bad when artsd dies
 yeah artsd i dont like
 membreya: wth are you doing?
 it still has its problems but its a lot better then it use to be
 incubii: arts is the lesser of the evils though. esd is worse.
 that's why alsa rocks :P
 true that
 and artsd typically crashes when I'm using kaffeine
 alsa isn't a server - or are you talking about some other alsa.
 I like how freedesktop standards make kde and gnome basically interoperable.
 i can see kde apps and gnome apps all in my applications list.
 kaffeine works better with my ipod then amarok does
 holy cow..they also can put things in the same notification applet.
 i like amarok a lot
 amarok plays static
 unless you know why
 amarok doesn't even play my mp3s :|
 plus it says theres no sound engine
 no idea... didn't ever use it until kubuntu
 well everything else plays fine
 i dont mint though
 im happy
 :D
 i like the statistics database you can register for
 lol and I can quite happily crash my kaffeine :P
 though the mac pc speaker is not the best for playing sounds
 i was letting it recommend music from my library based on what i was currently listening to
 but it will do
 I just have to tell it to add my 978 music videos to its play list
 locks the PC up lol
 and seeing how deep it would go into my music
 how well does it work ?
:\
 i was impressed with it... and the best part i find is that it uploads my listening habits to share with other people using the feature
 so it will recommend artists to others based on my listening
 ah
 interesting feature
 any idea why I get no sound out of amarok ?
 a type of information harvester that i totally support
 dunno membreya thats the problem i have
 lemme see if it works on my laptop
 says theres no sound engine so just plays static
 everything but amarok plays sound
 I don't even get that error message..says that it's playing ..but I don't hear anything
 so i know its amarok
 incubii, you need to install some output plugins for amarok
 man all i need is to whack in a wireless apple nic and this box is set
 aah just looked at engine, and there's nothing in there
 really?
 suggestions?
 a media player..with no default output..that's some clever planning :P
 amarok-engines ?
 maybe they arent allowed to include them or just plain forgot
 i choose arent allowed to as it causes conflict and much heated debate
 :D
 yes and amarok-gstreamer amarok-xine
 ok ill do that after the kernel finishes coming down
 see if that fixes it
 if kaffeine support ipod playlists id be set
 amarok works fine on my puter
 lappy as well
 man if linux could support ipods 100% with something as flashy as itunes i could move all of the office over to linux
 no more OS x
 :D
 but ...OSx :'(
 im not a big fan of it
 i like it
 but i prefer kubuntu
 it's soooooo pretty :)
 :P
 agreed it is
 i want a KDE theme that replicates it
 cant wait to see tiger
 ill have to upgrade the entire office to tiger the week it comes out
 :D
 membreya, get baghira
 mmm untested software in a work environment :P
 it's a style and window decoration that is OS X like
 untested software, thats what warrantis and SLAs are for
 hehe
 blame them!
 yeah baghira looks nice
 I'm not a big fan of OS X styles though.
 i like plastik/lipstick
 can you run adium in kubuntu?
 chavo: it won't have the pretty minimising action though :(
 much nicer on the eye then keramik
 what is adium ?
 messenger... adium.sourceforge.net
 membreya, that stuff will be coming soon. Can't stand it myself.
 id assume so dimmak
 If I minimize a window I want the thing gone.
 again chavo ...it's pretty :P
 but osx minimises it in styyyyyle
 well can you run any powerpc application in linux?
 not my style.
 expose is a great app
 define powerpc application
 do you mean OS X apps in linux ?
 all my computers are x86... but i have been playing around with pearpc a lot
 membreya, http://2sdw.com/images/3-13.png that is the baghira window decoration.
 power pc vs x86 architecture
 i run linux on PowerPC
 if i need an OS X app i just fire up MOL
 mac-on-linux :)
 i see
 runs OS X inside linux at native speed almost
 chavo: ...could it be ...true alpha blending
 never tried pearpc
 is it any good ?
 membreya, yes it's been available since xorg 6.8
 still a little buggy though
 not close to how you described mol... but pearpc is for x86 machines emulating power pc environments... it does on the fly translation of the power pc instructions to x86 instructions
 so you don't nearly the speed as a virtual machine that is not translating into different architectures
 it runs OS X though doesnt it ?
 yes
 i think QEMU can run OS X too now
 or they are getting there
 at a much reduced speed from the native x86 processor... they estimate it at 1/15 the native processor speed
 mac-on-linux is a ppc application... that is why it works great at what it does
 similar to vmware for x86 machines
 ah
 pearpc is bridging the gap between running mac-osx on an x86 machine
 thats right, CherryOS was a complete rip off of it
 which is a lot harder than the opposite
 yeah
 i need to install Synergy on these boxes
 get tired of using two keyboards and mice
 hehe my canary is chirping along to my dance music
 grrr amarok isn't even starting for me now ...ok I've gone into .kde/share/config and rm'd amarokrc ...where else is it hiding its config?
 wish i knew so i could tell you
 do i need to add my current user account to the drives group so that i can play dvds?
 i dunno, if you find out let me know!
 it pisses me off, i can burn but i cant play
 alright... i'll try it out... let me do all my upgrading... so i don't destroy my account while adding it to another group... happened on my desktop account
 nice having two installations to play with
 my internet is still borked on the desktop... and i blame autopackage
 have you tried redoing what failed ?
 yeppers... no luck
 it was a firefox autopackage
 beware... one of the developers could replicate the problem within firefox itself... my problem was system wide
 and i haven't repaired the damage
 so autopackage and kubuntu aren't playing well yet
 ah
 ill stick to apt-get/synaptic
 :)
 wait till it matures more
 yeah... i still like it... even if it hates my guts... oh the life of a stalker:-)
 lol
 poor thing you touch it once and it fucks you over
 worked fine for gaim
 Hi
 I have ubuntu 4 installed and want to install kubuntu-desktop via apt-get and when i go to do this i get a message saying "Couldn't find package Kubuntu-desktop"
 how do you restart artsd?
 any ideas
 verden do apt-get update; apt-cache search kubuntu
 ok thanx i'll try that
 if its not there you may need to add repositories, or its not availbable for warty
 hmm i dunno whether i should install firefox or just use konq
 membreya, noticed you asked the question about restarting artsd
=== froud-away is now known as froud
 i prefer firefox... but i don't think it supports search prefixes
 like typing "gg search string"
 for google and stuff
 ah
 and i like that feature a lot
 i think konq is doing a decent job of emulating the best of firefox
 that's me delltony :)
 by that you mean "gg:kubuntu"
 ?
 hadn't used it in a while
 namely.. I'm getting an error to say /dev/dsp busy
 don't remember it requiring a colon... but apparently it does
 is there a way to use the feeling lucky option that way
 yeah... i'll find the options
 just a moment
 there is a big list
 i usually truncate my favorites to single letters
web shortcuts
 ah ok
 wow i never knew that
 Question, I installed ubuntu a long time ago, then changed my sources to debian so I could get stuff I wanted.  Now I changed back to hoary, distupgraded.. trying to install kubuntu-desktop, but I am getting the error:kubuntu-desktop: Depends: python-newt but it is not going to be installed
 cool
 yeah.. it was something i got familiar with in windows
 using the tweak ui powertoy
 ah
 you can add any search engine you want too ... if one is missing
 wow it really does to im feeling lucky
 you can change the delimiter to a space:-)
 stuff firefox
 :D
 i think i wil
 no more colon for me
 i would add single letter shortcuts too... to make it even faster
 membreya, you simply killall artsd and it will restart when needed
 now i just need to add an address bar to a panel
 thansk man
 this will help so much
 yeah... i like it a lot
 you just increased my productivity
 i do my best
 all it needs is dictionary.com
 yeah... you can add it, i am right now
 same
 just go do a search at dictionary.com with a random string
 and replace that string with {@}... i think
 have to test... i was just comparing the other ones
 what plugins are people using for amarok to play MP3's?
 xmms engine
 ?
 that is what mine uses
 i only have xine, artsd & gstreamer
 just search for amarok in kynaptic
 already have all valid options enabled in kynaptic for amarok dimmak
 incubii: it is \{@} for the search string
 and it tells you
 oke doke
 kernel-smp 98%
 http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=\{@}
 :D
 that is mine
 for the search url
 vga=791 = 1024x768  so what is 1280x1024
 42?
 please note that is a joke
 yesh i know
 the meaning of life is 42
 :P
 whew
 who knows what catastrophe i might have caused
 lol
 you know what would rock of web shortcuts worked in xchat
 wow even doing it in the alt+f2 run dialog works
 im impressed
 yay... add run command to your panel
 and you can use it there too
 run command works as an address bar... good stuff
 :D
 man that rocks
 i use to do that with Litestep on windows
 have the run command accessible on the taskbar
 i have never been impressed with alternate shells on windows
 always very buggy
 bblean is nice
 so was yz dock
 never had problems with them
 others, yeah the were buggy
 i like having a desktop... without having to configure a bunch of plugins to emulate one
 very minimal... but took away too many features for me
 ah thats better
 now normal users can mount the ipod
 brb
 there we go now amarok works
 for mplayer, can I use the marillat-source from debian unstable, or is there another source for kubuntu?
 deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat unstable main <-- does this work on (k)ubuntu?
 faked, i use them work just fine
 delltony: ok, thx
 amarok works great now dimmak
 oh cool
 you will probably have some issues on the keys though faked
configure amarok
 you need to do gpg --keyserver www.keys.eu.pgp.net --recv-keys 1F41B907
 marcus top 3 list of annoying things in his install:
 3. can't change language to german at the moment
 2. hald stuff still  doesn't work correctly and now doesn't even know that / is mounted
 gpg --armor --export 1F41B907 | sudo apt-key add -
 1. constantly running kbuildsycoca after login
http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/dimmak/
 yeah it rocks once it works
 i have not heard of any of those bands
 might have to do with being australian though
 hmm a lot of people use chatzilla
 is it any good
 does kubuntu have a splash logo
 i prefer just using gaim
 for bootup?
 that shows your progress as things are loading?
 yeah
 like fedora core
splash screen
 or do you mean the boot loader?
 grub
 i don't think so
 brb
 wonder what i need to do then to get it. YDL, yellow dog linux for ppc has one. just prefer it too see the 640x480 dmesg text
 anybody successful with dvds? ..."Maybe you don't have enough rights for this, or source doesn't contain data (e.g: no disc in drive). (Error reading NAV packet.)"

 sorry my bad
 ignore, it finally worked :-)
 does anyone know any easy way to burn .wma files onto an audio CD?
 actualy kubuntu run perfect on hoary ?
 almost perfect
 it is a preview afterall
 Hi
 howdy verden01
 hows things
 yea alrite
 cool
 been using kubuntu for long
 since came out
 as an iso
 how longs that?
 i only have the first ubuntu but am now upgrading to hoary and will then install kubuntu-desktop
 i've always liked kde
 im nto really sure, lol
 :-)
 have u tired many other distro's
 tried
 yeah gtk-qt works again
 dunno why or how, but it seems to do ;-)
 what is that
 a gtk theme that makes gtk apps look mostly like kde apps
 hmm, i updated kde-i18n-de again, this time the right size i suppose, but i'm not allowed/able to change language settings in kcontrol...
 though i can choose german as language, but nothing happens, it won't even appear in the 'languages box'
 any idea? ;)
 noticed that myself just now
 did you try to log out of kde?
 i restarted x several times...
 that's weird then
 personally, i don't care for german much but others here sure do
 it's especially strange as ubuntu is big on i18n
 i've changed the locale settings in the kdeglobals file by hand (to de_DE), but again, nothing happens
 let's wait and see if any other has rather the same problems, maybe even with ather languages...
 mhhh is there any place i can get kde-bluetooth from?
 kde-apps.org, or maybe hints where to find there?
 did try rpmseek, it finds some debs but all links are broken
 hmm
 and the link on kde-apps.org is pretty much down, sf only has the source
 ah it's supposedly in kdeextragear
 hmm why cant i play DVDs
 dvd playing on linux isn't entirely legal
 so it's not installed by default
 what you can do: add universe and install videolan
 vlc?
 yeah
 yeah did that
 still no go
 that's weird
 works for me
 must be the PPC thing
 looks like i have to compile libdvdcss
 u using ppc?
 yea
 mhh on x86 it works
 but i can't remember if i had to install libdvdcss myself, actually
 once you go duel ppc its hard to go back to uni x86
 it was in the rep that i know
 lol
 didn't need to compile anything
 yeah only i'm not shelling out 2000$ for a dual g5 ;-)
 work related gift
 :)
 if i did, i'd probably run osx on it anyway
 i have to admin the things so its best taht i have one at home
 infact if i bought one
 i never quite understood why anyone would get an overpriced mac just to run linux on it ;-)
 i could do a tax write off
 as its required
 :D
 oh linux runs so fast
 don't speak of taxes, i should do my declaration today ;-)
 paying is bad, filling out the paperwork much worse
 just theres teething problems on PPC that arent in x86
 i woulda thought it would be easier to support less ahrdware
 probably best to use gentoo or some such on ppc
 nah gentoo was much much worse then this
 this works liek a charm
 i just want to watch DVDs
 i want to use bluetooth, but no kde bluetooth in sight anywhere
 ah well guess ill use windows box next to me till then
 i finally got rid of that plague
 you could always use osx you know ;-)
 hehe
 nah dont like OS X
 it doesnt like me doing things
 it's pretty but somewhat weird
 has a life of it's own me thinks
 and it's sloooow
 its like buying a bmw then wanting to rice it up
 what kind of weirdness is this? the deb for klibido needs libidb 0.5.13 but debian has 0.5.2
 i blame al gore
 he's on the board, doesn't mean he gets to say anything
 nah cause he invented the internet
 i blame jobs. he's a maniac
 :))
 the sole fact that he ships one button mouses says about everything
 but we all know it was george bush who did
 did you read on slashdot they are thinking of a two button mouse
 and they call it innovation
 lol
 best thing is you can hook up a normal mouse just fine
 in fact i don't know anyone who actually uses that crappy mice
 i have an MX1000 attached to it
 at work that is
 beyond me why anyone would pay that much for a mere mouse
 oh they are very nice
 it is a lot of money
 mhh yeah but a 10$ optical does the same job
 but then why would anyone spend $1000's on clothing
 maybe if you play 3dshooters all day
 when $2 tshirts do the same job
 so other people see they did ;-)
 lol
 i sit infront of a computer for about 18 hours of the day 14 of those are at work
 i stare at 2x30" plus 4x20" screens on 1 machine alone, i need comfortable equipment
 :)
 WTF do you work
 stock trading company
 :D
 ah ok
 im it support though
 IT*
 i've seen traders with 6 23" and the like
 well b4 we got the 30" screens they had 8x20"
 lol
 now they have what i mentioned above
 i'm still debating myself if i should switch to a finance major, actually
 and they are thinking of going for 4x30"
 i'd prefer 4*20 inch over 2*30"
 i thought of that too since i work in finance
 IT majors suck badly at my university
 well 4*20" is alright if you have good LCDs with small monitor edges
 and since IT is technically a faculty of economics department, i can switch for free
 cool
 i get half my work paid uni course off thanks to my work experience
 :D
 around here, uni is paid for by the government (save some measly 1000$ tuition a year)
 well we can defer our payment
 but then you end up paying it through tax after you earn a certain amount
 Hi are there known problems with kwallet? Since I made an update yesterday, its not working anymore.
 never used it
 wow i love that bug
 kde crash handler crashed
 ROTFL
 so now it endlessly crashes
 :)
 ah i hope the release fixes the bugs
 i think i will update kde
 come back next week it should be done
 :D
New Wallet. Do you get an dialog?
 give me a sec
 thaks
 i can't even open kwallet it seems
 thanks
 ah now
 i get a dialog
 also seems to continue when i enter some stuff
 hmm, did you do an update the last days?
 every day
 it would appear even having a dvd in the drive makes KDE crash horribly
 must be a ppc thing incubii
 I'll restart kde ...
 wallet works on here
 is there a way to have different colors for calendar categories in kontact?
 must be an x86 thing
 lol
 no idea
 doesn't seem like it is
 aaah under configure, not categories dialog
 kinda weird
 i hate when they change one lil package in the package list then i have to DL the whole bloody thing again on 28.8kb dialup
 i haven't been on dial up since 2000 fortunately
 these days i got 2mbit cable, goes swoosh and it's done ;)
 :P
 does that at work for me
 usualyl i just take my drive and plug it in another machine and dist-upgrade
 aw refreshing
 hi
 mfoxela, kwallet works in kubuntu ppc
 Hi after restarting kde, kwallet is working again, thank you for trying
 i love web shortcuts
 someone pointed them out to me today, and they rock
 sheesh this sucks. the egroupware konnector for kontact sometimes duplicates events
 yuck
 kill it
 rm -rf /
 NAH that can't be right
 school at 8:15 in the morning three times a week?
 I think this connector isn't ready for daily use, had lots of problems with it
 mfoxela: yes, for things like kwallet, kcoockiejar etc. they won't be functional properly until after restarting kde
 they want to kill me because of sleep deprevation
 to start the daemons
 apokryphos: I thought I did a restart after updating yesterday :)
 :P
 yay opensource flash for ppc
 and it works
 :D
 sort of
 lol
 is anyone here waiting for fixed translation packages?
 ie kde-i18n that works
 deb http://kubuntu.org/~halls/pkgs /
 I've put them up there until they are accepted into the archive
 haggai: the apache on there cuts the filenames short, can't really tell what the link leads to this way ...
 buz: that was to be added to your sources.list.  But do3cc_ just told me the packages are on the mirrors anyway
 ooh
 i overlooked the deb in front of the url
 haggai: define on the mirrors anyway... because the i18n I installed this morning still doesn't work
 marcusT: 'dpkg -l kde-i18n-\*' should show 3.4.0-0ubuntu2, not ubuntu1
 ubuntu1 was broken
 it does, but it's still broken for me
 wierd, I wonder why I didn't see this
 I'll see if I can get the packages from the mirrors instead of my locally built version
 because I use i18n-de, yesterday, I couldn't select any other language, now I can add geman, but it won't get added to the language list and does not have any effect
 marcusT: that works with the new package it seems
 doesnt for me...
 did you get them from the url haggai posted?
 works with those
 marcusT: which language are you trying to use?

 Linux anubis 2.6.11-1-powerpc-smp #1 SMP Fri Feb 11 16:46:07 UTC 2005 ppc GNU/Linux
 excellent
 heh
 whats the size of kubuntu-desktop install ?
 +80MB
 its the size of my left testicle
 :-o
 your left testicle is a virtual testicle?
 Pointwood: thx.
 that's the download
 it says it'll use up around 200MB of space
 Pointwood: thats clear.
 Probably. It pulls in a lot of things like OpenOffice, Konversation etc..
 how do you check for a list of maintainers using apt
 ok in windows explorer theres an option in the context mention to open up search for the current directory is there anyway to get this for knoqueror
 menu*
 Pointwood: before im test the live cd ;)
 :)
 i dont used kde 1.x ago
 what display manager do you recommend?
 no
 it daesnt work  anymore
 Pointwood: kdm, obviously. :P
 hehe
 in18-it  is there now  but  not selectable
 apokryphos: sounds like a very unbiased oppinion :p
 you mean, it ignores you if you click it?
 Impartial as a Judge.
 yes
 oh well, I can always change it later I guess
 _P_: sorry, haven't been following the convo. Did you add haggai's repo?
 uhmmm  no
 i am sorry
 No worries :P. Yup, they're uploaded up there [his repo]  until they're accepted into the actual archive
 _P_: It probably doesnt help. which version of kde-i18n did you install
 it
 (whoops, perhaps not; guessing)
 so, next up is a reboot I guess
 added
 kubuntu, it's not really necessary, but might be a good idea anyhow.
 well, a logout at least :)
 certainly
 see ya shortly...hopefully :p
 ok
 haggai:  daesnt  work
 i tryed  purging  the  old  one
 and reinstaling  ubuntu2
 but  it  is  there
 i click  on it  but  nothing  happened
 hmm, nothing new according to the kde-i18n-problem...
 and reinstaling  kde-in18-itubuntu2
 kde-in18-it-ubuntu2
 it has installed correctly, but i can't choose any language except the default en-us
 (in kcontrol)
 I do not believe this is a kde-i18n specific problem
 Since yesterday I have a similar problem with kopete
 there it simply ignores me if I try to log in
 hmm
 im glad i dont require anything other then the default english
 hehe
 english is also fine with me, but german would be nice ;)
 ok it seems the ubuntu-built i18n still doesn't have all the translations :(
 i suppose it has, maybe, but it's not possible to put them into kde yet...
 is gcc/g++ smp aware?
 incubii: no, do parallel makes
 incubii: make -j[number of processors]
 ah ok
 woa thats fast
 incubii: not all makefiles are testing with -jn so you might get extra breakage.  That's why its not enabled by default
 oke doke
 incubii: there is a semi-standard for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS for those packages that the maintainer has tested
 it compile SDL almost twice as fast
 hmm...what does kubuntu use for sound? mplayer doesn't work anymore...
 artsd
 Pointwood: aRts
 but, that shouldn't affect output of mplayer
 Pointwood: doesn't mplayer work at all or is there 'just' no sound? maybe then a closer look to kmix would help...
 hmmm
 i found in kmix if i have drc turned it i get no sound
 changing mplayer prefs to arts helped
 ah, ok :)
 apokryphos, :)  hey
 g'day
 oo session restoring

 i'm using kernel 2.4.27 on kubuntu and i want to install nvidia driver, i've compiled nvidia-kernel-source and build nvidia-kernel-2.4.27blabla and install it and now i can see nvidia on lsmod, then i've changed "Driver      "nv" to Driver      "nvidia"" on xorg.conf but when i try startx it will give an error like (EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to initialize the NVIDIA kernel module!
 (EE) NVIDIA(0):  *** Aborting ***
 (II) UnloadModule: "nvidia"
 is there an easy way to get sources for most everything?
 yuxel`: why you dont use 2.6er kernel's, 2.4.27 isnt supported
 buz: apt-get install kde
 or kubuntu-desktop
 i got kubuntu on this machine
 i want to build some stuff
 amu: winmodem drivers dont work on 2.6 :(
 http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92052 supposedly should be fixed since 3.3.1 but happens to me on kubuntu?
 yuxel`: ? see http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-3486.html
 amu: winmodem drivers dont work on 2.6 :(
 i've found the problem
 i've a package named linux-restrict-modules and it contains nvidia driver for 2.6
 that was the problem
 buz, if there is a precompiled binary, why not just use it? speed increases from custom compiles are negligible
 yuxel: what i read from google, they run with a 2.6 kernel
 oh, nvm
 amu: free drivers dont work :)
 you seem to have another reason
 randabis: there isnt one of kdebluetooth
 ex. ltmodem (Winmodem) is fully supported by ubuntu
 anyway, i've fix the problem
 thanks

 hey, anyone know if/when kubuntu will bring down the new version of gwenview that doesn't crash on double-click when its a kpart?
 Quinn_Storm: gwenview preview works for me
 buz: preview something in konqueror & then double-click on it
 ah that's interesting
 flat out crashes
 buz: yep its a known bug and they fixed it but kubuntu hasn't picked up the fix yet
 buz: its easy to just not double-click but it is slightly annoying
 buz: I do like gwenview though, its the only one of the four quick-viewers that supports animated gifs
 i hate anim gifs anyway
 does anybody know how to have kontact display the location of a calendar entry?
 (in the calendar overview i mean)
 http://www.nickmongo.com/images/sleepykitten.gif - one of the few good uses for animated gifs (I promise it is what it looks like it is from the url).  as far as the kontact calendar entry thing...what do you mean by location?  it should bold the font of days w/ entries...
 Quinn_Storm: you can set a location where the event takes place
 which is quite handy for people like myself who can't ever remeber where their lectures actually are
 buz: ah, not sure, I don't use kontact pretty much at all, though I may start eventually
 it's pretty neat especially with the egroupware integration
 Quinn_Storm: That's the best URL ever :)
 Quinn_Storm: thanks for the hint, I'll take a look at gwenview today
 gdh: thanks, I found it on the kitty pictures livejournal community I think
 Riddell: sure, its not a big deal as its easy to not double-click, but I just figured I'd bring it up
 how to mount an usb-stick
 i added a  line in fstab
 mind pasting it?
 and after  type media://
 on konqueror
 Should CDs / DVDs be auto-detected by hal / dbus?
 ohh it's automounted
 but thanks for that konqueror thing
 azad  is  automounted
 but  it  daesnt  work  without  a  line in fstab
 maybe there's already a line
 Could someone else give this a whirl to see if it occurs for them please:  http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102678
 I'm sure it does, but typically expect at least a month before it gets marked as NEW
 gdh: Was that in response to me?
 yes, sorry :)
 Ah, it's basics though, it had me really confused when I was trying to fix some HTML.
 WTF?  It's already been fixed and marked as a dupe.  I can't believe I didn't see that when I searched for it.
 ha cool :)
 I'm impressed by the response speed though.
 hm, that's a bit daft... default Konq from Hoary preview opens all text/plain docs in OpenOffice.org

 re
 mayday
 im installed the kde-i18n-hu but i cant setup the hungarian language
 From what I read here yesterday there were big problems with all translations..
 i.e. the packages were almost empty
 :(
 new ones have 'been uploaded' but I don't know how / when they'll make it round to the download mirrors
 underlord, actually, I don't think a reboot is required..I don't remember rebooting when I setup nfs anyway...could be wrong
 gdh: there is a problem with the ubuntu buildd infrastructure and I can't get working packages built today
 ooh
 gdh: you can download working packages from: http://kubuntu.org/~halls/pkgs/kde-i18n/

 haggai: thanks
 other newbie question:
=== Quinn_Storm is now known as Quinn_Away
 haggai: OK just wondering =) Would you be the person to bother about kitchensync / Konnectors?
=== Quinn_Away is now known as Quinn_Away[Showe
 kmail can handle my Maildir ??
 gdh: ah sorry wrong nick
 gsuveg: yeap, kmail does maildir.
 http://kubuntu.org/~halls/pkgs/kde-i18n/kde-i18n-hu_3.4.0-0ubuntu2_all.deb
 gdh: what exactly do you want to know about the konnectors?
 haggai: Specifically, getting the 'PocketPC Konnector' at http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/kde/konnector/index.php built for universe?
 It's near impossible to build this code standalone
 because it needs all the X, Qt, KDE Kitchensync devel files
 most of which don't exist as packages.
 and I don't fancy recompiling 90% of my system.. if I wanted to do that, I'd use Gentoo ;)
 It's just that without this Konnector, all of the SynCE / Raki / RAPIP/ Kitchensync framework is nearly useless.
 haggai: installed
 It seems a crying shame to waste all that work and to fall at the last hurdle
 my mails in Maildir
 maildur/maillist/....
 maildir/personal/
 etc.
 haggai: thats can use with kmail without import ?
 gsuveg: I wasn't talking to you about kmail
 gsuveg: I don't understand your question either
 haggai: sorry
 haggai: it works. thanks
 gdh: why do you need to recompile 90% of the system?  From the lbs you listed I think you'll only be missing kitchensync devel stuff
 hunger: have you understud my problem?
 haggai: Certainly the ./configure script for pocketpccommunication.tar.gz wants at least the X devel, Qt devel, KDE devel.. and I'm worried about things like mismatched symbols.
 esp. as there's no -dev package for kitchensync
 there have been a couple of other lost souls on here looking for a package of this Konnector, so I thought I'd bring the matter up here in the hopes it could be done 'properly' =)
 haggai: now im use mutt+maildir
 i would like use kmail, but me dont clear how can i handle maildirs with kmail
 gsuveg: At worst, install an IMAP server and connect IMAP to localhost?
 on my laptop? doh
 gsuveg: kmail expects all its mails to be in ~/Mail (IIRC they changed that to some hidden folder by default nowadays).
 hunger: /var/mail
 gsuveg: You should be able to set a symlink from there to wherever your mails are actually stored.
 membreya: Nope:-) Somewhere under ~/.kde.
 membreya: /var/mail is for incomming mails, not for storage.
 ooooooooooooh :D
 I guess having 'Mail' in a homedir is just asking for the clueless to delete it by accident =)
 gsuveg: kmail keeps adding some hidden files to that dir... You might want to clean those up if you ever move away from kmail.
 gdh: Well, I keep getting upset about having some app deceiding which non-hidden dirs I want to have.
 :) Policy decisions, gotta luv 'em...
 hunger: msg possible?
 gsuveg: ?
 hunger: can i send msg ?
 gsuveg: Dunno... try it.
 hunger: ah. like the imap server ?
=== apokryphos_ is now known as apokryphos
 gdh: the X, Qt and KDE devel libs should all be available, leaving just the kitchensync libs to worry about
 haggai: LOL it's the kitchensync stuff thatI have no idea about :)
 but I will try =)
 Is ubuntu using xorg or the xfree server by the way?
 x.org
 Ah, good:-)
 gdh: try apt-get source kitchensync
 haggai: K, thanks.
 Nice enough fellows... but I hated the "oh, just use xfree" attitude.
 haggai: Quickie, would I want libqt3-mt-dev or libqt3-dev
 I've never understood why both are there =)
 gdh: -mt- is best - it is built with multithreaded support
 thanks.
 gdh: non-mt is faster since it does not need to do locking, but you are safer of to use the mt version as long as you are not absolutely sure the programm is singlethreaded.
 gdh: And IIRC the kde apps all need the multithreaded version (-mt), so you will introduce a new dependancy when using the singlethreaded qt.
 hunger: Ah cool, mt it is =)
=== ttf_ is now known as ttf
 haggai: Sorry for the continued hassle - this is all new to me.. I've satisfied all the deps and ./configure completes fine, but this seems to be a CVS snapshot - there's a 0-byte Makefile... I've tried "make -f Makefile.cvs dist" but there's no ./autoconf.sh or anything
 haggai: is there a 'common practice' that I've missed?
 haggai: Scrap that, I just found out that pocketpccommuniction is deprecated already and replaced by something else :)
 does anyone know what package handles the cookie handling service for konqueror?
 I think I removed it by mistake
 randabis: thats extremely unlike -- I guess it would be in 'kdebase'.
 Blissex, well, I'm not sure...all I know is that the service will not start
 randabis: what is the name of the service that won't start?
 when I go into the cookie section of control center, it says "unable to start the cookie handler service"
 so konqueror is not handling cookies at all
 why show prety small fonts in other apps (as kde) ? for example gaim ?
 randabis: odds are you will find moe details in #KDE about these things...
 gsuveg: what does that mean?
 I'll go ask someone there
 Blissex: for ex. the gaim show 5px font
 Blissex: but in gnome-session it show 11 monotype
 gsuveg: is that what you want or not?
 not
 gsuveg: well, it all depends as usuall...
 Blissex: me sound like, all not kde apps fonts show smaller
 gsuveg: however KDE font selections do not extend to GTK/GNOME apps, but there are _two_ possible fixes.
 the firefox menu to small
 Blissex: whats thats ?
 gsuveg: the two possible fixes are: use a GTK/GTK2 theme (in '~/.gtkrc' or '~/.gtkrc-2.0') that selects the fonts you want...
 gsuveg: or use a delightful KDE extension that is a GTK/GTK2 theme that reads its settings from KDE, not from one of those files.
 gdh: heh
 Blissex: the 2nd sound better. whats that ?
 haggai: Am almost there - it compiles fine - just trying to get multisynk to 'see' it now :)
 gsuveg: I have it in my Control Panel under 'Appearance & Themes:GTK Styles and Fonts'
 gsuveg: you may have to install it explicitly though.
 is it posible to install kde from kubuntu on ubuntu?
 nydust: hmm?
 nydust: apt-get install kubuntu-desktop ?
 heh
 nydust: almost certainly yes...
 nydust: depends on which release of Ubuntu though.
 thanks
 cause i dony have a cd burner here, and just has installed ubuntu and want kde 3.4
 thanks
 Blissex, i have the latest and are upgrading to hoary now
 nydust: that should be ok...
 Blissex, thanks
 nydust: someone was however mentioning in KDE that the very most currrent KUbuntu packages are slightly dodgy right now.
 hmmm, not good.
 nydust: nothing critical at all; we can talk you through any problems. Just involves adding "clock" to kicker etc.
 maybee i should waith a bit more, to bether suport.
 kbabel part of kdesdk right ?
 do you know how i can enable dri on my mobile ati radeon card?
 nydust: It's up to you; they're no big problems though, at all. If you want, could wait till RC is out, though.
 so he should know :-)
 ;)
 ahahahahha  i come  from  cooker mandrake devel
 and  i can  tell you  that  kubuntu  issue are  nothing
 _P_: any tales from your long travels? :D
 heh
 in front  of  the  monster  problem  that mandrake  has  in this  fases
 Blissex: have you idea whats pkg the kde+gtk ??
 kubuntu is  better  now  than mandrake  10.1  power pack :D
 and  i use  both
 apokryphos:   kubuntu  crew  is  doing  a really  great job
 gsuveg: that would be 'gtk2-engines-gtk-qt'
 and this  channel  is  a  test
 Great/active devs, yes. :)
 5  users  one  month  ago ... look now :D
 heh
 Blissex: thanks
 gdh: cool
 haggai: Now kitchensync sees it, but nothing happens when I press 'Sync' - ah well, one for the synce-users list anyway. Cheers :)
 Blissex: im install and test later. now i have work :(
 someone  have  installed  kmobiletools ?
 to  talk  with mobile  trough bluetooth?
 can i chat with kopeta as with xchat ? one window for irc channels ?
 there  is  a  deb sources in the  site  but  some  lib  problem  installing
 es  gsuveg
 es = yes ?
 :)
 yes
 sorry
 if (es = yes) then echo "how ?" ;
 _P_: np :)
 gsuveg: I found kopete to be very crash-prone...
 gsuveg: Did not like it too much because of that.
 i like  kvirc
 how much memory is recommended for kubuntu?
 hunger: if can i resolve gtk font problem im stand with xchat+gaim
 hapo: many ;)
 hapo: i have 512
 is 128 megabytes of RAM bearable?
 :/
 hapo: imho use smaller wm with 128MB
 hapo: it is if you configure it very carefully.
 i just heard that kubuntu could suit better to low-memory systems than ubuntu
 hapo: the great advantage of KDE is that all KDE apps share the same libs.
 because kde consumes less ram
 than gnome 2
 hapo: this advantage works well if you use _only_ KDE apps.
 ok
 the distro would go to my laptop
 hapo: I have someone use kde3.3 on a Pentium 133 with 128MiB RAM.
 on my main desktop i have 512 MB :)
 SODIMMs are very cheap - get more RAM if you can :)
 hapo: It does run... but it is really slow.
 ok
 thanks for the information, anyway
 hapo: test xfce4.2
 hapo: but the girl does not know better and she is really happy with it.
 hehe
 hapo: also, it is very important not to use AA fonts, and use only X11 bitmap fonts if possible.
 hapo: and to use only the builtin themes of  QT and KDE, not anything fancy, and to avoid any sort of cool graphics stuff, including background images.
 hapo: also, to save on memory, I dont starte KDE using 'startkde', which starts a number of cool things like KDesktop, but just with 'kdeinit kwin; kdeinit kicker'.
 don't forget on many systems you'll have cups, postfix, inetd running... none of which may be necessary...
 hapo: you hear blissex? Use kde, but make it as boring and bad looking as possible;-)
 ssmtp dumb sendmail wrapper
? :-)
 humm, when i used a hdinstall of knoppix on the same computer the version of kde included with it ran quite ok
 but it was a little older version
 Blissex: Nope, I am not volunteering for that.
 hapo: knoppix is on kde 3.3 IIRC. That is not that different from 3.4. You should be fine if you could stand knoppix:-)
 well, maybe i should try this out
 at least kde should run much better than gnome 2 :)
 hi - before i install kubuntu on my cusins computer, i want to know a few things first. does kubuntu have a package repository yet, if so, how large is it. and does it come with ndiswrapper on the x86 install cd?
 hapo: grab the livecd and test that...
 i'm a gnome enthusiast myself but well, sometimes you have to be more pragmatic ;)
 SuperCatFrog: Ubuntu has a gigantic package repository, and it can also use just about all Debian packages...
 SuperCatFrog: Yes, there are three repositories, totalling Packages files of just over 3M
 No idea about ndiswrapper.
 Is ndiswrapper even legal?
 Probably as legal as Wine is...
 hunger - in the uk it probably is
 hunger: sort of... Nobody has complained so far.
 ndiswrapper is GPL, isen't it?
 it's up to whatever license you get the Windows NDIS drivers under.
 also, is there any difference between ubuntu (after apt-get install kde) and kubuntu? im not sure if i'd rather use ubuntu with kde
 So why may you use it to load non-free drivers?
 SuperCatFrog: however 'ndiswrapper' is a bad bad idea. It is easier/cheaper to just get a supported WiFi device.
 SuperCatFrog, you'd want apt-get install kubuntu-desktop; not apt-get install kde
 hunger: Why isn't Ark non-free because you *might* use it to open .RARs of warez?
 hunger: remember the non-GPL driver exception for the Linux kernel itself...
 blissex - i cant do that, im installing it on my cusins computer, im not paying for a new wireless card for him, and he wont want to buy one
 apt-get install kde would be overkill
 randabis - why?
 SuperCatFrog: Possibly, possibly also try Kanotix or Knoppix if KUbuntu does not do that.
 gdh: With ndiswrapper you are loading non-free code into the the address space of GPL code... that is not allowed in the GPL. Opening non-free data is different.
 it would install EVERY kde package iirc..including kdetoys, kdeaddons, etc, etc
 you'd have a mass of bloat
 hunger: OK, I have no idea how it works internally :)
 Blissex: Is ther such a exception in ndiswrapper?
 randabis - thats fine by me
 but not for people wishing to save on disk space, and not for people who do not wish to have packages they'd never use
 kubuntu aims to balance things out, as ubuntu does with the gnome desktop
 Nice catch 22 :)
 Stupid that...
 reboot time =)
 SuperCatFrog, ndiswrapper should work fine if the card is supported by it...you'd just need to get the ndiswrapper-utils package, and a copy of the windows drivers
 I have ndiswrapper working on my laptop for instance...well, it works, but I cannot get connected to my network now for some reason ever since we switched to WEP.
 wireless is working fine with the atmel drivers on my desktop though :)
 randabis - how can i install ndiswrapper-utils without a network connection?
 SuperCatFrog, I believe the package is on the cd
 o ok
 thanks
 would i be best with ubuntu+kde or kubuntu?
 both are the same
 ok thanks
 kubuntu is not a fork of ubuntu..it is part of ubuntu
 Ah yes I see what people mean about the current dist-upgrade breakage :)
 although ubuntu+kde will give you a bunch of gnome stuff, while kubuntu by it self doesn't...
 that's true
 got a skystar 2, does anyone know how to get it working under linux? (that's a DVB card)
 azad: You've looked at the linux-dvb list at linuxtv.org ?
 no i'll have a look and find out what this is
 All the modules needed should already be in ubuntu - should only be a matter of loading them
 I dunno if the SS2 needs any firmware, etc.
 hm
 gdh i found an entry with my card.. does my graphics card 3d acceleration and so on have to work?
 lunitik: part of kwin package
 cause i never handled to get the radeon running
 azad: No, the SS2 is a budget card - it only provides a data stream
 Riddell: hmm... where do I configure it?
 okay
 whether or not your 2D display is up to showing full screen video is fairly irrelevant :)
 mh okay
 so then.. i think i have to get a programm to watch?
 Riddell: nm... I think I found it  :)
 Yeh, I'm not so sure about all those apps - I have a full DVB card and use VDR...
 I know nothing about the 'WinTV' style apps..
 VDR is an application that would work?
 azad: No, VDR's intended for building a standalone set top box, it's probably not what you're after.
 mhh
 It also would need you to configure some kind of software MPEG2 decoder plugin.
 messy
 heya
 oh.. well.. then i'll give google a chance to find something
 i am  going  to  hate  amarok
 thanks gdh :)
 everytime i start  this program  it  scann  al  my  HD building i don't know  why
 azad: Good luck :)
 _P_: I already do and went back to beep-media-player :)
 It's at least GTK2 based...
 uff
 _P_: yah! iI noticed that too...  I wonder why?
 amaroK also uses *huge* amounts of RAM.
 ah  so  it not only  my  problem?
 uhmmm
 i was  thinking  about  some  strange  setting
 _P_: nope... :)
 well, I didn't see any place to turn off "hog all my RAM" ;)
 so if you find it, let me know
 ;) ok
 find it
 it is  a  small  cross  on the  right up  corner
 :D
 :D
 amaroK has crashed! We're terribly sorry about this :(:(

 But, all is not lost! You could potentially help us fix the crash. amaroK has
 attached a backtrace that describes the crash, so just click send, or if you
 have time, write a brief description of how the crash happened first.

 In Soviet Russia, RAM uses YOU!
 Many thanks.

 one question, can I change language setting in to kubuntu?
 _TeRmInEt_: from en to other ?
 yes
 _TeRmInEt_:  yes
 yes
 http://kubuntu.org/~halls/pkgs/kde-i18n/
 but in this  days  there is  a problem  with kde-in18-XX  pacets
 *packets
 Most of the regional packages are broken in the release...
 download new ones from that URL
 ah
 cool
 i try to download correct version
 _TeRmInEt_: it works
 gdh: san marino
 Ah! :)
 thanks  gdh
 it  works
 how do i change the resolution?
 on my screen?
 how would you do it in windows?
 i only get a choise to change the background
 on theleft you have 'Background' 'Behavior' ...... 'Display'
 try 'Display'
 it would be kool if more development tools where included with kubuntu
 thanks
 strange i used 1400xsomething before i did and apt-get dist-upgrade, and now i can only use 1024x768 cause if a go for an higher resolution. I get and big box on my mouse and the screen splits in two parts. do any have a tip?
 Hi running kubuntu here, one problem i've noticed is concerning mounted samba shares, after a while of it being mounted it seems to stall, at first it was just bringing konqy down (or amarok), now it brings teh entire system down, this seemed to happen in 2.6.10, so i upgraded to 2.6.11 and still teh same behaviour, anyone know of something similair, i had some output from dmesg, but not wanting to bring my system down atm, i'll see if teh lo
 great, it work!
 gdh much tnx!
 =)
 how can i choose beetwen gdm and kdm ?
 gsuveg: update-alternatives will work
 or just fiddle the symlinks manually in /etc/alternatives for 'x-display-manager'
 sorry, x-session-manager
 I think :)
 gdh: lemme see
 a debconf or other dont works?
 or...
 just uninstall the one that you don't want
 i dont whant
 gdh: alternative ok
 not
 x-session-manager = gnome-session dont gdm
 i whant start kdm dont gdm
 change it to run startkde instead of gnome-session
 that's what it does on my system
 /usr/bin/startkde
 and you login via kdm?
 yes
 lemme see
 gdh: sorry for newbie questions, im test kde now
 =)
 last version what i used was 1.3
 wow that's quit a vintage..
 yepp.
 i was a p233 laptop and on netbsd
 any of the Kubuntu graphic guys here
 gdh: hmm. gdm start after reboot too
 why not just apt-get remove gdm
 :)
 then it remove ubuntu-desktop :/
 no it won't
 it's only a meta-package
 I guarantee you that it won't pull out your entire system :)
 It scared me a bit at first when I saw the Debian equivalent of it wanting to uninstall 'x-window-system'
 ubuntu-desktop is safe to remove
 so is kubuntu-desktop
 there you go - two complete strangers have said it's OK, so it must be OK :)
 lol
 randabis: i dont remove gnome
 well the main reason is because those packages don't actually contain any data...they just have a number of dependencies that aren't removed when you remove the meta package
 gsuveg, what I said has nothing to do with removing gnome
 randabis: ok.
 http://img17.exs.cx/my.php?loc=img17&image=snapshot55vk.jpg
 is that xorg with composite?
 yes
 gdh: sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm
 ha, I Know ;]
 what vga card? nvidia
 ?
 nvidia geforce fx 5900
 aaah
 ati still can't do composite :-((
 hence why I don't have an ati card
 gsuveg: Ha, cool :)
 better than remove :)
 gdh: hey, the kde dont bad ;)
 you do realise that you can just tie the chroma + luma pins of an S-video output together and it wil be usable as composite?
 composite' adapters you can buy will do
 haha
 gdh: whats the good mp3 player ?
 amarok?
 we're not talking about that kind of composite gdh
 gsuveg: I like beep-media-player.
 we're talking about the compositing feature of x.org
 Oh =)
 the screenshot of my desktop I posted shows it in action with kubuntu
 I was wondering.. who on earth is still using composite video thesdays
 lol
 ah right, eye candy then =)
 my 8-bit nintendo
 yes :)
 k, time to eat.. bbl
 dimmak:   awww man
 dimmak:  nintendo NES... what memories
 dimmak:  I *love* it
 dimmak:  in many ways more than SNES

 i just play all the lovely games
 moreso via emulators now
 lately tried some n64 emus on the beamer
 hello...
 sure rocks to play micromachines on a 2m screen LOL
 I've got some problems with i18n in french... is it normal ?
 it was broken earlier today
 might still be
 gdh: beep have no arts ?
 is it bad form to request package additions in bugzilla?
 yes, mailing lists better for that
 at least that's how we prefer it in Ubuntu
 does anyone here have a sonoma ?
 is the kde upgrade of today working or will it nuke my taskbar again?
 buz: all right...
 maybe backup my home first ;-)
 once burnt twice shy
 none with a sonoma ?
 spiral: Ordered mine, don't have it yet.
 hunger: 'm going to buy one tomorrow... & wanted to know if there was any hope with linux...
 spiral: Don't know yet:-(
 hunger: all right, I'll keep asking somewhere else... hope I'll know
 does sonoma use a new wlan chipset?
 spiral: Keep me informed.
 hunger: all right
 buz: Nope. same as centrino.
 buz: except some 802.11a configurations...
 just cpu upgrade?
 buz: Only the chipset did change.
 aaah
 ah yeah it went to 533fsb
 buz: yes, chipset, and cpu speedsteping working kind of differently, and ddr2, and pci expres
 buz: PCI express, other RAM chips, that kind of thing
 if the graphics core is supported i'd say it should work
 pci express should be pretty transparent to the os
 buz: I hope so:-)
 buz: I found a nvidia card... hope their driver will work
 it should
 and for speedstepping... I hope to...
 too
 buz: I think I saw some pci express fixes to the kernel recently.
 i'd expect it to be mostly the same
 well maybe to take full advantage of pcie you nee dupdates
 but from what i hear, win can do without them so linux should work as well
 buz: I just hope I'll find graphic drivers when I got the new laptop.
 buz: I love your optimism
 hunger: I hope too
 hey i like the bleeding edge ;-)
 well if you go nvidia it shouldn't be much of a problem
 i'd stay away from ati
 buz: Mine will have a ATI :-(
 no composite for you then ;-)
 neither for me
 but i need a new box anyway
 buz: There is a new free driver over at sf.
 gatos?
 buz: r300.sf.net
 aaah, i got R250
 besides i'm too lazy to buld from source
 it's a major pain on debian systems
 buz: Is it? Don't they have the module-assistent?
 i don't care
 everything worse than make, make install is bad to a long time bsd user ;-)
 (which of course includes fetching the whole dependencies etc ;-)
 buz: That includes almost everything!
 buz: you get a configure in almost everything... and you need to download first.
 na
 bsd ports do that all for me
 like gentoo, only working ;-)
 buz: Heared that... what are you doing with ubuntu then?
 freebsd's desktop support ain't that good
 gentoo sucks big time! Don't compare *BSD to that:-)
 it's not bad per se but no supported java sucks
 and i need to code java for school
 so i stick to ubuntu for the time being
 gentoo doesn't suck
 it only takes ages to get up and running
 not really
 I can get a working gentoo system going in under a day starting from stage 1...with a full gnome environment
 what you got? quad opteron?
 start from stage 3 and the time easily is cut in half

 is it  crashing  on closing?
 _P_: works for me on athlon xp
 the  last  version?
 0.6.0 ?

 0.6 yeah
 uhmmm
 mhh didnt restart it so far
 kaffeine is working just fine with an athlon xp on this end
 thanks
 Kopete crashes at each close (i.e. shutdown) but I'm used to that :)
 Not at all related, I know..
 plays streams just fine
 can i use a kernel specialy compiled for athlon-xp in vmware (were the host hardware is an athlon-xp)
 mhh hard to tell
 id should work
 but you'll have to try i guess
 I doubt it... vmware will be emulating a Pentium, or maybe a 486 that just happens to run really fast :)
 I can't see it passing through all the manufacturer-specific extensions to the guest OS
 :(
 my kaffeine doesn't close properly - it leaves itself in ram after I close it - and thats on i386 version.
 i deleted  .kde/config/kaffeinerc
 but is  sill crash  closing
 i close the  application
 LeeJunFan: And it's not just hiding in the ashtray?
 sorry, system tray :)
 i doubt vmware will be emulating a 486
 it  disappiared  but  stay  on bg
 that's a seriously weird cpu
 with  100% cpu
 oooooooo
 gdh: nope - hehe. I actually had about 15 running my cpu up to 100% I had to killall.
 LeeJunFan:  me  too
 classy :)

 Hey, today kde-i18n has received an update, but it doesn't work, right?
 Now in kcontrol I can see the other language(s), but I cannot get them activated
 anna: get the required packages from kubuntu.org/~halls/pkgs/kde-i18n/
 those work
 I wonder if Kubuntu is less than Debian unstable looking at the last days :p
 well its only a preview after all
 remember that kubuntu ist still in 'prerelease' status :)
 *g*
 how can i put trash to dekstop?
 well, yes I do, but Debian unstable never gets released and didn't do those things to me
 1. Kill my i18n, even after an update
 2. Kill my kicker config in an update
 anna: im today installed the kde, and im happy with it
 anna: huh?
 I am used to update daily and not find anything broken.
 whats a good gui irc app for linux and where would it be in apt?
 Bizzeh: Konversation is good
 Not of the obvious kind at least.
 Bizzeh: You also have the choice of using Kopete's IRC module.
 and I dunno if KSIRC is in Ubuntu
 3. I still cannot install kdeaddons on amd64, why?
 anna: the trouble with the locale settings, i agree, but beyond this, i had no more trouble according to the kde-i18n...
 gdh: it is
 but i'd suggest konversation
 buz: There is no kde-i18n-de on that URL?
 a qt/kde frontend for irssi would be nice
 buz: Ignore me :p
 :)
 there is
 it's just hard to find ;-)
 there isn't

 Any ideas??
 try and install  libzvbi0 directly - might give more hints
 chances are you'll have to follow that down a chain of broken depends
 I'm a noob, how do I do that?
 Are there any other TV applications?
 tony: sudo apt-get install libzvbi0
 This is the response: the package is missing, has been obsoleted
 tony: where do you get kdetv from?
 I followed the instructions at www.kdetv.org/
 it told me to update my sources.list
 apt-get update

 Any ideas??
 the package should be there, maybe really a dependency's problem, or something's wrong with your sources information...

 coruja - how do I install deb files?
 dpkg -i filename.deb
 just be ready for dpkg to complain loudly about broken dependencies...
